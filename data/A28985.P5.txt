apprenons de ce experience que puisque le poids de l air et le poids de l eau qui est dans le pompes se tiennent mutuellement en equilibre il pesent precisement autant l un que l autre qu ainsi en connoissant la hauteur ou l eau eleve en tous le lieux du monde nous connoissons en mesme temp combien chacun de ce lieux est presse par le poids de l air qui est au dessus eux et partant que le lieux qui sont au bord de la mer sont pressez par le poids de l air qui est au dessus eux jusques au haut de sa sphere autant precisement que si au lieu de cet air substituoit une colomne eau de la hauteur de pieds deux poulces ceux qui sont plus elevez de dix toises autant que il portoient de l eau de la hauteur de pieds un poulce ceux qui sont elevez audessus de la mer de toises autant que il portoient de l eau la hauteur de pieds onze poulces ainsi du reste nous apprenons par ce experience que l air qui est sur le niveau de la mer pese autant que l eau la hauteur de pieds deux poulces mais parce que l air pese moins sur le lieux plus elevez que sur le niveau de la mer et qu ainsi il ne pese pa sur tous le point de la terre egalement mesine qu il pese differemment par tout ne peut pa prendre un pied fixe qui marque combien tous le lieux du monde sont chargez par l air le fort portant le foible mais peut en prendre un par conjecture bien approchant du juste comme par exemple peut faire estat que tous le lieux de la terre en general considerez comme il estoient egalement chargez air le fort portant le foible en sont autant pressez que il partoient de l eau la hauteur de pieds et il est certain qu il n pa un demy pied eau erreur en cette supposition nous avon veu que l air qui est au dessus de montagnes hautes de toises sur le niveau de la mer pese autant que l eau la hauteur de pieds poulces et par consequent tout l air qui etend de puis le niveau de la mer jusqu au haut de montagnes hautes de toises pese autant que l eau la hauteur de pieds un poulce qui estant peu pres la septieme partie de la hauteur entiere il est visible que l air compris depuis la mer jusques ce montagnes est peu pres la septieme partie de la masse entiere de l air nous apprenons de ce mesmes experience que le vapeurs qui sont epaisses dans l air lors qu il en est le plus charge pesent autant que l eau la hauteur un pied huit poulces puisque pour le contrepeser elles font housser l eau dans le pompes cette hauteur par deffus celle ou l eau contrepesoit deja la pesanteur de l air de sorte que si toutes le vapeurs qui sont sur une contree estoient reduites en eau comme il arrive quand elles se changent en pluye elles ne pourroient produire que cette hauteur un pied huit poulces eau sur cette contree et il arrive par fois de orages ou l eau de la pluye qui tombe vienne une plus grande hauteur c est parce que le vent porte le vapeurs de contrees voisines nous voyons aussi de la que si toute la sphere de l air estoit pressee comprimee contre la terre par une force qui la poussant par le haut la reduisist en ba la moindre place qu elle puisse occuper qu elle la reduisist comme en l eau elle auroit alors la hauteur de pieds seulement et par consequent qu il faut considerer toute la masse de l air en l estat libre ou elle est de la mesme sorte que si elle eust este autrefois comme une masse eau de pieds de haut l entour de toute la terre qui eust este rarefiee et dilatee extremement et convertie en cet estat ou nous l appellons air auquel elle occupe la verite plus de place mais auquel elle conserve precisement le mesme poids que l eau pieds de haut et comme il n auroit rien de plus aise que de supputer combien l eau qui environneroit toute la terre pieds de haut peseroit de livres et qu un enfant qui scait l addition et la soustraction le pourroit faire trouveroit par le mesme moyen combien tout l air de la nature pese de liures puisque c est la mesme chose et si en fait l epreuve trouvera qu il pese peu pres huit million de million de million de liures ay voulu avoir ce plaisir et j en ay fait le compte en cette sorte ay suppose que le diametre un cercle est sa circonference comme ay suppose que le diametre une sphere estant multiplie par la circonference de son grand cercle le produit est le contenu de la superficie spherique nous scavons qu divise le tour de la terre en degrez cette division este voluntaire car l eust divisee en plus ou moins si eust voulu aussi bien que le cercles celestes trouve que chacun de ce degrez contient toises le lieues autour de paris sont de toises et par consequent il lieues au degre autres en comptent mais aussi il ne mettent que toises la lieue ce qui revient la mesme chose chaque toise pieds un pied cube eau pese libres cela pose il est bien aise de faire la supputation qu cherche car puisque la terre pour son grand cercle ou pour sa circonference degrez elle par consequent de tour lieues et par la proportion de la circonference au diametre aura lieues donc en multipliant le diametre de la terre par la circonference de son grand cercle trouvera qu elle en toute sa superficie spherique lieues quarrees c est dire toises quarr c est dire pieds quarr et parce qu un pied cube eau pese livres il ensuit qu un prisme eau un pied quarre de base et de pieds de haut pese livres donc si la terre estoit couverte eau jusques la hauteur de pieds il auroit autant de prismes eau de pieds de haut qu elle de pieds quarrez en toute sa surface ie scay bien que ce ne seroient pa de prismes mais de secteurs de sphere et je neglige expres cette precision et partant elle porteroit autant de livres eau qu elle de pieds quarrez en toute sa surface donc cette masse eau entiere peseroit livres donc toute la masse entiere de la sphere de l air qui est au monde pese ce mesme poids de livres c est dire huit million de million demillions deux cent quatre vingt trois mille huit cent quatre vingt neuf million de million quatre cent quarente mille million de livres mr pascal small
