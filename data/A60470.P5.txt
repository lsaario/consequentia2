partly foregoing reason chiefly coldness wind blow frosty weather generally north easterly wind whose coldness strangly contract air consequence thicken plain unsealed thermoscope whose ball air

higher frosty weather quicksilver already high foreshews snow reason snow formed extreme coldness capable condensing air powerfully extreme cold without consequence make thick weighty quicksilver
