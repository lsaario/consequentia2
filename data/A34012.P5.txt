melchisedeck aaron consist viz aaron offered bloudy sacrifice beast melchisedeck offered unbloudy sacrifice bread wine also false likeness priesthoost melchisedeck iesus christ doth consist viz melchisedeck sacrifice bread wine iesus christ sacrifice body bloud specie bread wine humane invention founded neither scripture reason contrary apostle writing hebrew placeth difference priesthood melchisedeck aaron likeness christ quite another thing first called melchisedeck interpreted apostle saith heb 7 king righteousness king salem king peace herein well represents lord iesus christ truely king righteousness righteous always without sin also satisfaction hath purchased righteousness u made unto u god righteousness also truly king peace hath reconciled men unto god made peace angel hath particularly recommended peace aaron high priest king much le priest romish church consequently cannot order melchisedeck written life pope sufficiently declared righteousness peace procured true faithful servant iesus christ shall shew large elswhere secondly apostle heb 7 represents melchisedick u man come heaven without father without mother without descent neither beginning day end life really one moses hath wholy concealed u father mother descent birth death might type christ without father man without mother god without descent god man neither beginning dayes god end life god man father descent birth death aaron high priest exactly described moses never pope bishop priest whose parent birth death known consequently cannot order melchisedec thirdly apostle add melchisedec made like unto son god abideth priest ever▪ moses make mention death one succeedeth priestly office might type iesus christ never le priestly office exercise untill end world always interceeding presenting sacrifice god father continually aaron priest dead successor pope bishop priest die dayly successor consequently order melchisedec fourthly apostle saith likewise melchisedec took tithe abraham add melchisedec blessed promise viz abraham le blessed greater whence appears melchisedec taken tithe abraham blessed levi priest person evcellent abraham successor promise fulfilled must need incomparably excellent received believe priest romish church bold prefer abraham father faithfull whose seed nation earth blessed consequently order melchisedec fifthly apostle never spoke sacrifice melchisedec far comparing sacrifice iesus christ like aaron unlike adversary say nothing else meer humane invention answ last answer mounsieur indeed false two first point viz difference priesthood melchisedec aaron consist aaron offered bloudy sacrifice beast melchisedec offered unbloudy sacrifice bread •… nd wine also deny likenesse priesthood melchisedec jesus christ doth consist melehisedeck sacrifice bread wine christ sacrifice body bloud specie bread wine answer say false also impious contradicts scripture unanimous opinion holy father contradicts scripture scripture say plain express termes christ took bread hand said body took wine cup said bloud yet pertinaciously say founded scripture reason confess reason comprehend christ body host yet contrary reason yet reason believe christ said word truth omnipotent also word royal prophet apostle concerning everlasting priesthood sacrifice melchisedec must need verified christ said since cannot verified bloudy sacrifice also proved strict sacrifice imaginable whereby verifie masse stand scripture reason melchisedec sacrifice bread wine christ sacrifice body bloud specie bread wine consequently likeness priesthood chiefly consist manner sacrificing say human invention say liker divine inspiration since holy father concurr impudent denial without proof consident word force weight weaken hurt say apostle writing hebrew doth place difference priesthood melchisedec aaron likenesse quite another thing first called melchisedeck signifies king righteousnesse king salem signifies peace type jesus christ truly king righteousness king peace aaron say high priest king much lesse priest romish church consequently cannot order melchisedeck good sir leave apostle disparity betwixt melchisedeck aaron viz melchisedeck king aaron thones name signified righteousness peace thothers placeth difference priesthood person viz melchisedeck king priest perfect type jesus christ aaron priest king grant shews difference priesthood body may see yet difference priesthood person thing prove apostle never able difference sacrifice therefore though aaron romish priest king consequence huge slaw slaw hath second consequence say apostle heb 7 concerning melchisedecs coming heaven without father without mother without descent neither beginning day end life say shew difference melchesedec aaron person melchisedec perfect type christ aaron shews difference manner sacrificing consequently touch priesthood least reduplicatively ought make mounsieurs consequence slawless word apostle viz melchisedec made like unto son god abideth priest ever make third consequence follow smoothly quite u you▪ son god abideth priest ever follow sacrifice ever must perpetual sacrifice perpetual sacrifice cannot cross though effect perpetual yet sacrifice self past gone new bloudy sacrifice cannot offer christ die rom 6 therefore must unbloudy sacrifice offered minister mistical member must correspond christ everlasting priesthood holy sacrifice mass offered specie bread wine symbolized bread wine sacrificed god melchisedeck consequently sacrifice mass word apostle sacrifice according order melchisedeck christ continual intercession u heaven mr de rodon surmizes sacrifice least strict one yet christ strict priest ever must strict sacrifice answerable hisstrict priesthood ever first priesthood doth
