opponent small one asmuch matter fact may clearly demonstrated least much milion person employed clothingtrade hath dependance wholly upon said manufacture hence evident much opponent hath mistaken

merchant interest cloathier artifficer consistent interest nobility gentry contrary made sufficiently appear opponent third argument wooll twelve pound per pack year wooll prohibited following year sold sixteen pound per pack wooll ever since reason said prohibition pretended fallen price worth four five pound per pack argument seems failure two respect one wooll nation hath never bore price since time prohibition whereas may made appear year wooll bore considerable price ten pound per pack twenty foure pound per pack according goodness said wooll continued time shews u another mistake argument fall price wooll wholly ascribed prohibition whereas indeed two cause evident first discouragment hath put upon clothier upon vent woollenmanufacture french king arbitrary imposition upon

great quantity sent abroad forreign part bear almost smale price beyond sea therefore argument opponent hath assigned cause cause may clearly appear matter fact wooll bore good price better said prohibition many year till breach commerce put upon u french king wee mentioned unfortunate act must humbly crave leave call made importing irish cattle upon supposition would raise price land england whereas quite contrary effect hath much experienced viz hath laid foundation impoverishing england quickly fear recovered next thing alleged oppoent limited exportation wooll advantage woollen trade
