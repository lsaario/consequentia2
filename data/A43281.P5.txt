becomes corporified whence afterwards stone metal tree herb animal brought forth notorious birth produced without union father mother father mother must united union birth third thing may accordingly brought forth necessary viz male father female mother must kin symbolize forasmuch birth proceeds must compleatly part partaker nature essence without cannot true perfect birth union father mother order birth mean performed according body body yet reason modern philosopher assigne suppose body devoid life never made partaker according spirit body made doth consist hath attained perfection must improvement advance reduced body considered looked upon dead wholly lifeless thing aggregate onely corporeal part put together corporeally may touch another body cannot united though part brought utmost smalness imaginable union performed unity indivisibility say spirituality indefinitness hath made body cannot attributed body body may superadde union performed unless thing united penetrate pierce one another notorious sensible comprehensible body cannot intimately pervade pierce one another onely outwardly touch contiguous follows therefore union performed according spirit mean according body susceptive inward penetrating union except first reduced kind spiritual body spiritual corporeal must suppose coolness moon mean spiritual coalition commixture spiritual warmth sun comprehensible being produced due time reduced spirit q union father mother sun moon performed said birth brought forth r birth cannot without preceding impregnation neither impregnation without two viz father mother according common usual course nature father cannot impregnate mother self neither mother impregnate father onely remains father must impregnate mother impregnation performed nothing
