wherefore could conceive thing nature possible done power whatever repugnant nature thing would repugnant first notion ought rejected absurd else intimated must doubt truth first notion consequence also god thing ever howsoever perceivd miracle understood work repugnant fixt order nature far evincing existence god contrary would make u doubt without might absolutely certain knowing thing nature follow fixt immutable order let supposd cannot explicated natural cause miracle may understood two way either hath indeed natural cause cannot investigated humane understanding hath cause god thing

distinctly understand much right calld work god referrd understand although strongly exercise imagination ravish men admiration forasmuch work nature clearly distinctly understand render knowledge god sublime clearly shew decree therefore understand thing recourse god talk impertinently shew bigotry wit ridiculously profess ignorance viii moreover could conclude thing miracle yet could never thence conclude existence god since miracle work limited never implies certain limited power certain evident effect cannot rightly infer existence cause whose power infinite cause whose power greater say

better concluded fixt immutable order nature conclusion speak miracle understood nothing else work transcends humane understanding believd supposed destroy order nature interrupt repugnant certainly could give u knowledge god contrary would take u knowledge naturally make u doubt god thing acknowledge difference betwixt work contrary nature work nature pleasd speak work truth repugnant nature cannot produced effected power alone since miracle done non extra naturam sed ipsa natura though held supra naturam yet still must interrupt order nature conceive decree god fixt immutable therefore thing done nature follow law would necessarily repugnant order god hath universal law nature establishd universe consequently belief would make u doubt thing else lead u atheism thus grosly mistaken force reason alledged sufficiently demonstrated second place intended reason take liberty conclude de novo miracle nature nature meer absurdity therefore miracle holy scripture nothing else rightly understood work nature either really transcends humane understanding believd ix nevertheless assurance truth new doctrine think self concernd confirm part affirms miracle cannot know god humbly conceive may done recourse authority holy scripture though ex professo plainly teach position viz god made known u miracle yet notwithstanding found many place rightly understood may concluded easily genuinely among chiefly deuteronomy 13 moses command people israel put death false seducing prophet though work miracle word text correct translation arise among prophet dreamer dream giveth thee sign wonder—and sign wonder come pas whereof spake unto thee saying let u go god thou hast known let u serve them—thou shalt hearken unto word prophet dreamer dream lord god proveth know whether love lord god heart soul—and prophet dreamer dream shall put death c clearly follows miracle may wrought even false prophet men unless well guarded true knowledge cordial love god may easily induced miracle embrace serve false god acknowledge worship true god add lord god proveth know whether love c secondly israelite could many miracle form mind sound conception notion god providence experience self

solomon though excellent wisdom king jew even affair nation highest point prosperity able form competent notion god read concerning miracle recorded book moses eccles 3 v 19 20 21 chap 9 v 2 3 c confesseth suspected thing happen chance far seems concluding divine providence belief miracle prophet may without much labour collected writing none well understood order nature event men could brought consist conception notion formd mind providence god yet hath always clear philosopher endeavour clear conception rightly understand thing mean constitute true felicity nothing vertue tranquillity mind studying bring nature obey contrary bring obey nature certainly knowing god directs nature universal law thereof particular law humane nature require take care mankind whole universe constant therefore even sacred writ miracle give true knowledge god clearly teach providence designed prove found place scripture unattentive reader may seem perhaps irreconcileable doctrine exod 10 v
