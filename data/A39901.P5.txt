thereof begin enumeration evil consequence attend low valuation silver principal whereof want sufficient quantity money payment tax rent carrying trade nation prove excessive want scarcity money certain fatal consequence fixing low rate silver think single consideration sufficient disswade practice certainly method regulating coin carry fatal pernicious consequence occasioning great scarcity money render u incapable paying tax rent management trade impoverish nation degree incapacitate u continuance war thereby oblige u consequently rest europe truckle ambition power france say method draw consequence must acknowledged hand unfit pursued low valuation silver would cause great scarcity money would great measure produce fatal effect may conceive evinced ensuing consideration fixing low rate silver produce excessive scarcity money may partly evinced consider silver shall recoind together milld unclippd money still remaining go far near million pound sterling recoind low rate value augmented evident compare quantity money tale may recoind clippd money reckoning silver penny per ounce quantity may made silver reckoned fourth part viz per ounce may computed judicious mr

gentleman would silver fixed erit mihi magnus apollo ill erect altar praise sacrifice memory hand silver advanced fourth part viz unto per ounce ought proportion present scarcity thereof sequel discourse quantity silver furnish u fourth part money would coind rate present establishment instead l shall proposed advancement silver l nation nine hundred thousand pound inconsiderable addition coin juncture besides augmentation silver coin advancement silver raise gold proportionally full fourth part supposing may two million pound sterling sort gold coin nation silver raised proposed value pas full fourth part l otherwise would advance gold added silver demonstrates l tale kingdom fixing higher rate silver would setting lower valuation thereon pas next reason prove excessive fatal want money consequence reducing silver low value must obviate one grand objection foresee urged already advanced object though granted quantity silver gold make money tale advancing value bullion debased lower value yet though money coind low rate go far tale yet purchase much good real intrinsick nominal imaginary value regarded sell commoditiesto answer though measure true price good bear proportion goodness badness coin wherewith purchased yet proportion exact fully ballance dare undertake purchase good coin quantity silver coind money set pretty high rate weight silver coind money fixed lower rate though indeed real intrinsick value principally regarded yet totally exclude consideration extrinsick value denomination put upon also person especially subject prince whose money bear respect unto accept payment something bare intrinsick value evident consider though think granted coin taken altogether full per cent one half le worth time first intrinsick value therefore according rule good rising falling fully much ballance several degree goodness money inland foreign commodity advancd full one half former price exchange money fallen one half former rate neither find happend even money reducd worst estate ere certain whether would reformd examine pricecurrent commodity twill found advancd near per cent one another much risen account badness coin great measure occasioned extraordinary demand many beyondsea great difficulty hazard importing war course exchange also never fell much former rate money former intrinsick value think coin perfection weight purity course exchange roterdam amsterdam c seldom exceeded dutch shilling pound sterling coin debasd worst estate exchange place seldom lower shilling pound sterling per cent difference coin best condition though said money become generally per cent worse first intrinsick value think evident neither good advance exchange sink fully ballance baseness lightness coin whence follows weight gold silver valud higher rate go purchasing commodity well tale weight lower value fixed since clipt counterfeit money buyes commodity sort proportion real intrinsick value money best estate ever proportion real intrinsick value thereof time therefore quantity silver valued pound go something farther purchase even foreign commodity well tale quantity valued pound point designed prove hold measure even foreign traffick much certain relation inland trade advancement price money make go tale also purchase furnish u larger stock traffick among self extrinsick value denomination coin regarded well real intrinsick one dealing one another encrease extrinsick value denomination money cause go payment purchase good would otherwise every regulation coin ought equal superior regard interest domestick well foreign commerce service former money seems principally intended designed answer thing could easily reckond equally divided made answer one another due consideration interest inland traffick regulation money seems wholly neglected great stickler low valuation money whose measure seem chiefly calculated meridian forreign trade particular interest insomuch hope judged breach charity conjecture true motive party acted affair many foreigner trading commodity coming holland sound streights c may instead making return good remit money thither specie extraordinary goodness whereof propose gain per cent exchange know cannot done money fixd pretty high rate tho may true yet doubt many person opinion whose intention undoubtedly generous honest wheedled designing selfinterested person think act otherwise affair would done left pursud dictate better impartial judgment hope sufficiently enervated force grand objection prolix one plausible cause afford proceed mention second reason prove excessive scarcity money consequence nonadvancement silver reduction silver low rate prevent going far tale purchase otherwise would also great discouragement importation gold silver kingdom carrying mint thereby cut hope procuring bullion increase coin need prove increase money juncture melting clipping indirect mean reduced small quantity must concluded publick good consequently proposal tends deprive nation advantage augmentation coin universally acknowledged must necessarily judged repugnant publick interest low valuation silver tends prevent increase money evident consider person carry silver mint per ounce besides likely gave considerably yield better price elsewhere fixing low state gold silver would effectual prohibition importation kingdom carrying unto mint law could enacted purpose third reason evince excessive want money ensue non advancement gold silver fixing low value silver discourage importation kingdom carrying mint cut hope increasing quantity coin also temptation person melt transport render impossible u preserve even little shall left conveyed nation supposing government impose hard term carrying plate coined per ounce le cost thereby quantity money present augmented nay imagining double quantity money possible u yet value setled rate present establishment per ounce process year would insensibly melted transported would remain sufficient quantity supplying urgent occasion nation would involved greater exigency distress ever hope ever experience urged meer scarecrow terrifie child fool withal appeal sad experience never spake clearer case doth doth inform u general though enacted severest law backd execution rigorous penalty commission crime prospect certain gain yet never wanting person sake thereof hazard enduring greatest punishment doth experience teach u general law obeyed violation whereof gainful observation profit breaking great certain penalty dubious easily avoidable doth even present experience furnish u pregnant instance relation particular subject coin since fifteen million silver money appears register mint coined since time king henry eighth one third part computed remaining specie rest either melted transported may rationally judge future already past nay rather may conclude silver gold scarcer dearer many account several year past setled low rate encouragement melt transport greater ever industry therein would consequently ordinary reason imagine reason temptation much augmented diligence lessened person stick commission crime obtaining le advantage scruple procuring greater reason appear yet unanswerable besides clandestine illegal conveying silver land proved inevitable consequence scarcity goodness money also thereby ensue inconvenience viz neighbour supplying u good thereby become debtor consequently must pay owe please accept may certain choose return whereby shall gain silver reduced low value choose return much whereby shall length draind money reduced scarcity want money affirmed think proved consequence nonadvancement silver cause poverty disable u pay tax rent manage trade though single instance mischievous effect setting low valuation silver yet one black extensive nature draw numerous dismal train ill consequence along spare labour adding much prove disadvantage practice however shall mention second grand inconvenience attend nonadvancement silver viz making money great weight low value mightily obstruct sale manufacture inland commodity neighbour abroad amongst self home neighbour money made extraordinary goodness said choose return made good possible cause commodity fall much hand want buyer mean time neighbour taking much money good u possible thereby together concurrence cause mentioned foregoing head occasion want money mightily obstruct vent inland commodity even among self much prejudice domestick well foreign commerce great scarcity money oblige person retrench usual expences employ money thing pure necessity trade subsist furnishing thing pleasure ornament humane life kind greater part trade nation subsist must necessarily droop decline person money sufficient gratifie necessity pleasure obliged baulk latter serve former least disappoint one two amongst commodity fall much reason scarcity money may certain corn cattel product land bear proportion tenant cannot make much product farm used impossible pay landlord usual rent land tenement must necessity sink considerably present yearly rent diskindness hopeful project reducing silver low rate per ounce succeed procure gentleman landlord estate england low rate silver causing scarcity money scarcity money naturally causing advancement interest thereof perhaps double present rate advancement interest money certainly lower purchase land several year increase money high land yielded year purchase contrary interest money lowest land sold year purchase evident compare purchase land king henry eighth time interest money l per cent per annum purchase land interest third part time always observed price money advanced thereby specie increased interest thereof fell grew le according interest money fell land advanced several year purchase manifest observe much land england hath improved since aforesaid time king henry eighth interest money high upon whole may see much gentleman landlord england obliged person proposing method regulating coin introducing scarcity money cause product consequently yearly rent land fall considerably also advance interest money thereby lower purchase land several year conceive time throughly represented fatal consequence ensue fixing silver low rate impartial reader time cannot sensible destructive course would publick good proposed enforce reason advancing price silver representing advantage would accrue nation thereof measure handled former head enumerated ill consequence contrary course advantage raising silver reverse directly opposite unto disadvantage fixing low value thereon good effect one best seen opposing bad one method shall briefly setting low valuation silver cause pas little way payment contrary method make go far possible former discouragement bringing silver coind cut hope increasing quantity money latter affords imaginable incouragement importation kingdom carrying mint coind mean may hope great plenty good money ever yet nation setting low valuation silver temptation convey kingdom fixing high rate thereon mean preserving coin intire unmelted low rate silver obstruct exportation commodity neighbour choose money good contrary advancing silver pretty high rate induce choose commodity rather money thereby incourage trade manufacture preserve money kingdom manage inland trade short low rate silver cause scarcity money oblige person retrench usual pleasurable expences thereby occasion decay great many trade depending thereon setting high price silver thereby causing plenty thereof nation enable person spend freely advantage trade one produce scarcity silver cause commodity among rest product land fall considerably consequently land sink something yearly rent contrary advancing silver would keep commodity tolerable price would preserve present yearly rent land finally fixing silver low rate cause scarcity must necessity advance interest money thereby cause land fall several year purchase contrary advancement silver causing proved plenty money plenty must consequently lower interest thereof lessening interest money experience evinces advance land several year purchase hope sufficiently evinced necessity advantage raising price silver come fix particular rate humbly conceive requisite advanced judicious mr lowndes seems understood matter better treated besides judge one fourth part present establishment ounce silver must consequently raised unto per ounce may done two way either retaining weight fineness addition fourth part extrinsick value every milld crown must ordered pas piece proportionable method advancing silver coining le weight still affixing value regulation standard one new crown piece pas consist pennyweight half within inconsiderable fraction piece proportionable method come one effect shall thought fit make use latter method diminishing weight retaining extrinsick value better make new crown answer shall left old establishment requisite besides half crown also coined quarter crown piece one whereof added new crown make exactly answer old milld crown piece shall remain former standard rate setled silver coin soon reduce gold proportion according guinea worth rate humbly conceive publick interest fixd authority moreover prevent extraordinary loss fall heavy particular person falling per piece viz unto one instant like left take course judge would prevent inconvenience loss ensue upon equally born nation may effected ordering fall per piece ever month first six month next ensuing date order publishd effect fall per piece every month next six month commence expiration first six month person shall commanded take rate shall currant respective month penalty forfeiting value money shall refuse gold coin fall proportion whereby month time gold coin reduced true value trouble loss thus divided among nation general would inconsiderable almost insensible born particular person would much impoverish family whilst rest escape scotfree person shall thus obliged take guinea good would reimburse measure making better price commodity likewise hope paying guinea away month expired perswaded ordinance would received almost universal satisfaction thus gone first indeed principal point intended discourse therefore shall brief remains second general head proposed enquire shall loss ensue recoining clipt counterfeit money sustained unto part query relates clipt silver money resolution parliament loss thereof shall made good publick sufficient reply yet undetermined loss occasiond counterseit money sustained hope may permitted communicate opinion loss thereof born one part publick several proprietor sollowing proportion viz counterfeitmoney hath mixture incorporation silver intirely brass copper iron metal owner shall upon carrying mint allowed much said money shall weigh rate per ounce troyweight paid partly silver shall found said money carried melting separation thereof residue tax parliament shall think fit lay purpose money raisd shall note given entitling bearer thereof unto much sterling money said counterfeitmoney carried amounted unto weight per ounce paid allowance per cent per ann said value counterfeitmoney time payment method poorer

two million may supposd mixd metal would hardly weigh one million bad money generally le lighter clippd silver loss another million least lightness money fall also proprietor publick loss million pound sterling weight four million ounce mixd course silver make good said metal may one another worth ounce according advancd price silver loss part publick would exceed l yet would great ease poor must otherwise obligd dispose bad money unreasonable low rate goldsmith others buy think hardly good reason given wherefore publick sustain loss clipt silver equal force prove nation much obliged sustain least part loss counterfeit money shall suffice answer second general enquiry loss clipt counterfeit money ought sustaind third head proposd enquire mean may mint supplied sufficient quantity bullion make near much good money tale time good bad together answer briefly general effectual mean accomplishing already strongly urgd viz advancement price silver encouragement importation silver kingdom carrying mint propose particular mean effecting would humbly advize gold silver plate throughout kingdom excepting quantity sort shall judgd fit reserved according person several degree estate orderd brought mint coind money rate per ounce answerable silver whereby notwithstanding reservation certain quantity judgd fit would near two million good sterling mnney added coin nation without
