second branch first first part justification consisteth making u cleane remission sinnes merit christ bloud two second part justification consisteth making u whiter snow imputing christ perfect righteousnesse unto u errour deny christ bloud hath made believer cleane hath purchased full absolute pardon sinnes hold hath indeed answered obtained u remission pardon fault say eternall punishment due u sinne ever committed hath answerd obtained u remission whole punishment temporall punishment due u sinne must answer satisfie god justice self either life purgatory dead convincing errour give evident testimony ground scripture answer chiefe reason alledged defence foure argument lord word hath given u errour though stop mouth obstinate papist men never convinced iannes iambres withstood moses still resist truth reprobate concerning faith apostle speaketh tim never bee brought beleeve truth yet argument may make wilfull folly papist maintaining errour manifest unto men fully satisfie conscience christian falshood first apostle expresly teacheth rom condemnation kind condemnation eternall temporall christ iesus true beleever vulgar latin papist absurdly holdeth bee authenticall sacred originall readeth nihil damnationis one jot condemnation bee condemnation reserved true beleever whole punishment due sinne remitted condemnation adjudging man punishment word used every scripture mat shall condemne death mar condemned guilty death condemnation belong due christ sinne forgiven manner punishment belongeth endured neither eternall temporall neither secondly christ hath redeemed faithfull whole curse law due sin christ hath redeemed u saith apostle gal curse law giveth reason made curse u bare u himselfe fully answered satisfied justice god surely saith prophet esay hath borne griefes carried sorrowes temporall punishment due u sinne part curse law plaine deu among curse law threatneth sin number temporall judgement threatned saviour beare endure u part onely

curse punishment certainely deliver u n ne thing might become curse punishment unto u therefore evident christ hath redeemed u eternall even temporall judgement also due u sin thirdly whose sin soever lord doth christ sake forgive forgiveth fully never remember even hee saith lord esa blotteth thy transgression mine owne sake remember thy sinnes forgive iniquity saith againe ier remember sin never remember certainly never punish scripture phrase remember men sinnes signifieth nothing else punish remember iniquity saith prophet iere visit sinne againe hee remember iniquity saith prophet hosea

apostle ephes even god christ sake hath forgiven requireth u forgiving one another remit fault onely punishment also rendring evill evill railing railing saith apostle pet contrariwise blessing thus see cleare holy scripture first errour papist full absolute pardon christ hath purchased soule dischargeth acquitteth fully sin whole punishment due unto two maine objection every man heart apt make truth touching ful e pardon christ hath purchased bloud every one truly beleeve object first may say falleth god inflicteth many punishment life upon faithfull misery best god servant subject unto punishment sin wherefore doth living man complaine saith prophet lam man punishment sinnes many god people dyed wildernesse david expressly saith psalme thou wast god forgavest though thou didst take vengeance invention though moses aaron doubtlesse obtaine god pardon unbeliefe shewed water meribah yet dyed wildernesse sinne god would suffer enter promised land wee may see plainely number though god pardon david foule sinnes upon repentance gave assurance also prophet samuel yet plague neverthelesse light upon god threatned sinnes hee pardon pardon seemeth exempted temporall punishment due sinnes answ answer though misery affliction life owne nature punishment sin fruit sin sin first brought world therefore also oft scripture called punishment levit amos yet punishment men two evident demonstration first god inflicteth punishment upon man sinne bee many great judgement affliction lord hath laid upon faithfull wherein hath respect sin cause therein intend judge vindictive manner correct sin disciple seeing man borne blind iohn thought bee punishment sinne either himselfe parent beene guilty saviour disalloweth judgement point saith neither hath man sinned father hee say neither man sinnes parent cause lord smote man blindnesse work god might bee made manifest iobs friend judged grievous affliction beene punishment grievous sinnes hee beene guiltie lord sharpely reprooveth rash censure iob yea hee telleth satan iob hee mooved destroy without cause may say iob sin enough deserve asmuch endured yes verily wage due desert every sin death apostle teacheth rom iob without sin himselfe confesseth iob sinned shall thou preserver men yea imputeth affliction sin thought cause thou writest bitter thing saith iob makest possesse iniquity youth thought sin youth brought upon therefore also f diligent search examination owne heart wayes best god servant like case might find speciall sin moved god thus afflict yea craveth god helpe shew saith hee iob wherefore thou contendest many min iniquity sin make know transgression sin hee say know many wayes offended thee shew speciall sin hath thus provoked thee afflict doth lord say satan moved afflict iob without cause surely meaning nothing cause whereby god mooved thus afflict therein punish sin cause even tryall hee might make patterne example faith patience church ever saviour telleth apostle manifold misery endure shall put synagogue saith iohn whosoever killeth thinke doth god service unto peter saith iohn thou shalt bee old thou shalt stretch forth thy hand another shall gird thee carry thee whither thou wouldst shall wee thinke meaning thus thus god correct punish sin sinnes ever committed cause whereby god moved bring affliction verily hee telleth matth thing befall sin name sake speaking peter hee signified ath hee glorifie god evangelist saith iohn cause peter dyed violent shamefull death sinne hee might glorifie god secondly neither affliction god inflicteth upon faithfull sin properly accounted called punishment fatherly chastisement correction onely punishment speake properly god licteth upon sinne curse fruit wrath wherein hee seeketh good party punished glorifying owne justice upon satisfying righteous law judge doth condemning executing malefactor respect also god punishment called evill thing make peace create evill saith lord esay shall evill city saith prophet amos lord hath done affliction faithfull unto blessing curse blessed man thou chastenest lord saith prophet psalme iames blessed man endureth tentation blessed yee men shall revile persecute rejoyce exceeding glad saith saviour mat fruit speciall love wrath lord loveth saith apostle heb chasteneth scourgeth every son receiveth many love rebuke chasten saith saviour rev seeketh good destruction satisfying law glorifying justice upon know saith apostle rom speaking specially purposely affliction faithfull thing worke together good love god wee judged saith apostle corinthian wee chastened lord wee condemned world every father usually correcting child seeketh nothing good thou shalt beat rod saith salomon proverbes shalt deliver soule hell would beate doe good howsoever mortall parent faile oft correct child sometimes rage without respect good heavenly father never doth father flesh saith apostle hebrewes chastened u owne pleasure hee profit wee might bee partaker holinesse yea hee could procure good repentance holinesse keeping awe perishing way well would never scourge afflict behold melt try saith lord ieremy shall doe daughter people said else keepe perishing bring heaven deale thus many god people beene able say david psalme owne experience good beene afflicted perijssem nisi perijssem received good affliction thing world thus answered first objection notwithstanding affliction faithfull endure life yet pardon christ hath purchased bloud full absolute perfectly discharged onely sin also whole punishment due sin object may objected secondly soone ever purged hysope soone ever bloud christ applied u spirit god made perfectly cleane sin beene taught need commanded pray daily unto god forgivenesse r sinnes saviour teacheth u mat wee full absolute pardon yet must sue seeke day life answ answer yes verily though christ hath bloud purchased u full generall pardon yet must sue god forgivenesse sin every day first respect sinnes formerly committed remember sinnes youth transgression saith david psalme remember u cryeth church psalme former iniquity though lord hath forgiven wee doe measure beleeve forgiven yet faith weake wee

though respect god merit christ bloud generall pardon purchased given yet respect u respect benefit pardon commeth u sinne pardoned unto u actually bee committed nay wee doe repent beleeve christ christ commanded repentance remission sinnes preached name luke actuall remission sinnes without repentance act give prophet witnesse name whosoever beleeveth shall receive remission sinnes said man receive remission sinnes benefit pardon till hee doth truly beleeve respect respect new sinnes wee fall every day necessary wee praying pardon renew repentance faith every day thirdly lastly respect desert sinnes though sinnes bee never freely fully pardoned nay though wee never good assurance also self yet becommeth u daily begging forgivenesse nourish self sense desert sinnes worthy wee perish everlastingly way u escape avoid onely god free mercy pardoning thus doth prodigall luke even father forgiven fully expressed also much unto running meet falling necke kissing yet hee still cryeth

lecture cxxx psalme october followeth wee proceed unto two dangerous errours papist hold doe concerne second part justification god papist bee asked whether poore sinner may attaine perfect

confirmed god word cavills justified god inherent righteousnesse wrought u spirit god justified god righteousnesse christ imputed u alone first truthes doe confirme five point necessarily premised opening unfolding meaning first whosoever god doth justifie account bee sight hee doth also sanctifie make inherently hee doth holy spirit infuse grace whereby doth change heart make wicked holy good man man christ saith apostle corinthian hee new creature old thing past away behold thing become new man say justified god man truly beleeveth christ remaineth still man first obtained mercy man comfort justification findeth himselfe sanctified without holinesse man shall see lord saith apostle heb lift face boldnesse comfort unto yea say secondly lord justifieth none hee make perfectly holy
