contract legal pollution uncleannesse also diver washing injoyned cleanse pollution apostle teacheth u heb 910 leprosy soulest pollution law speaketh ceremony performed priest cleansing washed water may see levit 148 cleansed shall wash cloathes shave haire wash himselfe water hee may bee cleane yea touched dead body beene tent man dead one least pollution one law could subject unto could cleansed till washed himselfe water shall purifie himselfe saith law numb 1919▪ wash cloathes bath himselfe water shall cleane even man could purged legal uncleannesse greater smaller unlesse hee

would himselfe answ answer beg god benefit use outward ceremony▪ inward spirituall grace signified ceremony shadowes figure substance body sacrament christ merit shadow thing come saith apostle col

wash filthinesse sinnes thy sonnes bloud lord sprinkle apply unto conscience thy holy spirit shall bee cleane thy sight yea cleane onely whiter snow qu • st 3but yet third question remaineth david expresse request plaine termes thus darkly shaddow veile legall ceremony answer answ two respect 1 reverend esteeme ceremony selfe ordinance god 2 remembrance thinking ceremony helpe faith made better able conceive benefit desired receive bloud christ namely water able cleanse soule filthinesse ever could benefit must bee sprinkled upon soule spirit christ water wont priest bee sprinkled upon body bee cleansed law word thus opened doe yeeld unto u sundry profitable instruction consider verse first lump altogether two thing observed 1 reverend account david great prophet maketh small ceremony used law use made helpe received washing bunch hysope used sprinkling cleansed 2 understood spirituall meaning rested outward ceremony hee might receive man seeketh god doe worke upon bestow upon inward grace signified ceremony secondly consider verse particularly severall branch three point observed 1 meanes whereby desired hoped cleansed sin washing water signified bloud christ 2 meanes whereby water bloud christ made effectuall lord sprinkling upon bunch hysope 3 benefit assured receive washing purging cleane yea whiter snow point speake order first mark nota david great prophet esteemed reverently received helpe faith small ceremony appointed god washing used law sprinkling hysope use teacheth u outward help god hath appointed u worship doct 24 yea least ceremony
