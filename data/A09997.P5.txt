speake doe use habit thus sampson power spirit power use strength act 4 32 said apostle spake boldly power must know act 4 32 may common grace heart yet want power spirit come put strength inward man worke accordingly thus said spirit came upon saul hee prophesied hee able doe could doe yet know may true grace yet present want action may want power doe ought spirit seemes absent himselfe soule apostle spake heb 11 brother forgotten consolation spirituall strength power hid dead forgotten spirit returne shall finde power good againe fourth way whereby spirit strengthens 4 worke grace soule giving efficacy power unto meanes growth speciall meanes strengthning inward man hee set building furnisheth roomes give power unto soule use make effectuall hee give power efficacy unto meanes strengthning inward man know word onely meanes worke new habit quality u call u beget u unto christ spirit adde unto namely efficacy would never beget u unto christ therefore meanes make effectuall give blessing unto meanes grace word alone without spirit told scabberd without sword sword without hand doe good though stand never much need therefore apostle joynes together act 20 32 calles word

hee powre water upon dry ground heart barren grace holinesse shall spring holinesse grow strong inward man shall shall powre spirit upon therefore see spirit doth strengthen grace soule building setting building grace soule furnishing roomes new habit quality grace giving power unto soule use habit good giving blessing unto meanes grace use stand thus spirit onely meanes strengthen inward man vse follow whosoever hath holy ghost hath strength whatsoever strength man may seeme unto himselfe proceed spirit true strength false counterfeit strength man may thus argue cause unto effect true

difference betweene godly sorrow 4 quest false answer differ three thing especially 1 obiect 2 cause answ 3 effect first difference object object worldly sorrow punishment sinne 1 wrath god lookes upon without relation christ object godly sorrow sinne stand opposition love god towards christ howsoever regenerate man lookes upon punishment yet different degree much feares punishment give father cause take displeasure sinne hee principally lookes upon viz hath displeased good gracious father god hath beene unto workes humiliation see wrath god hell death finall separation betweene happinesse hereupon feare punishment humbled thus see difference object second difference cause cause worldly sorrow either judgement 2 present either upon person substance family else judgement hee feares god inflict upon hereafter either rich credit reputation amongst men therefore feare humbled cause godly sorrow apprehension sinne contrary unto nature purity perfection god also god love towards man hath eye given whereby see rich god love unto reflects upon himselfe see carriage towards god mercy finding proportion betweene hence growes sorrow hee thus requite god sinne mercy third difference effect 3 doe proceed one ground bring forth contrary effect three fold first worldly sorrow drawes affection heart god see judge cannot love father take god enemy therefore doth flye expects good see adam cain iudas godly sorrow make man cleave faster unto christ sticke faster unto grace whets affection love christ prize christ workes willing readinesse soule obey put would make flye christ secondly worldly sorrow hurt body breed disease wasts consumes intrailes breed brings consumption body duls make dead soule take away rellish spirituall thing make man carelesse good daules make man unwilling unto good godly sorrow life soule health body quickneth soule man unto good put new life workes readinesse love affection christ grace holinesse thirdly worldly sorrow make man hot fiery spirit stirres evill reproach disgrace neighbour fils full hatred revenge envy godly sorrow breed another kind spirit make meeke quiet spirit wordly sorrow put reproach disgrace wrong put injury wrong whatsoever else hee meet withall christ thus see difference betweene fifth question shall know 5 quest whether sorrow godly sorrow answer shall know three thing 1 ingredient answ 2 continuance 3 event first say shall know ingredient first onely sence 1 punishment common unto worldly sorrow say howsoever property worldly sorrow apprehend punishment yet likewise required godly sorrow sensible punishment another light put whereby hee see uncleanenesse sinne see sinne owne dye onely sinne bee sinne sinne bee vile hereupon content himselfe mercy unlesse may grace care may free punishment whether hee hath strength corruption secondly shall know continuance 2 godly sorrow constant worldly sorrow passion mind change last though present may violent strong worke much outwardly yet come fit continues like land flood violently present overflowes banckes away againe alwayes thus godly sorrow like spring still keepes running dryed runnes still violent sure shall still running winter summer

spirit never rest till hath toucht christ till peace nothing satisfie till christ come soule till christ nothing make remove confidence trust hee hath christ thing shall goe christ worldly sorrow hath another successe namely flye faster away god showed iudas caine thus much question sixt question seeing object godly sorrow sinne whether degree 6 quest godly sorrow answer howsoever sinne chiefest cause godly sorrow yet notwithstanding answ admits degree diver degree according unto apprehension thing conceived sorrow lesse according proportion grace received every one one degree cause every one properly sinne degree sorrow proceed threefold cause first god give grace unto one unto another doth intend make great building grace hee lay deepe foundation godly sorrow contrary doth intend bestow

reason except man broken heart constant 3 reason christ serve half fit constantly passion rule man truly humbled hee keepe close unto christ man unstable god doth esteeme friend doth esteem friend unstable knowes depend upon hee stand whether shall need whether hold close knowes therefore apostle saith unstable heart shall receive nothing god iames 1 7 8 god accept iames 1 7 8 thing doth thus see lost labour till humbled men unwilling loose labour thing much heart beleeve second motive whatsoever profession man make religion nothing 2 motive worth till man humble reason men doe hold profession fall away loose first love throughly humbled pride heart smothereth forme seeming grace last corruption hollow heartednesse made apparent unto profession nothing worth without humiliation till humble cleere reason first reason except bee truely humbled wil wither hold 1 reason profession quality first ground plow gone deepe enough throughly humbled seed sowne open profession christ

cross reproches disgrace hee shall meete withall seeke disjoynt christ vertue none draw christ till humbled grow strong til humbled felt weaknesse good way strengthen grace third reason till man humbled hee sowes seed amongst thornes hee sowes amongst 3 reason lust choke destroyes whatever good duty doth performe know men sow seede among thornes place unfruitfull unseasonable men would accounted unwise men men humbled sow many holy action amongst lust therefore remaine poore grace till man bee truely humbled sinne mortified everie unmortified lust thorne every seede grace heart
