doctrinam ordinis intrusa meditus e manuscripto doctrina de sacramento ordinis cap displicet nobis vehementer illa clausula nam ut illa sub uno supremo rectore varios diversos ministrantium continet ordines ita visibilis christi ecclesia summum ipsius vicarium pro unico supremo capite terris habet cujus dispensatione sic reliquis omnibus membris officia distribuuntur ut suis quaeque ordinibus stationibus collocata munera sua totius ecclesiae utilitatem cum maximum pace unione exequantur primum quod cum de christo dixerit sub uno supremo rectore de vicario ipsius dicit unicum supremum caput quibus verbis plus aliquid tribuitur vicario terris quam ipsi christo coelis majus nempe est esse unicum quam esse unum esse unicum supremum quam esse unum supremum esse caput quam esse rectorem deinde quoniam falsum est summum pontificem esse unicum caput quemadmodum enim omnes apostoli erant caput ecclesiarum ita apostolorum successores licet summus pontifex caput sit sic amos dicuntur optimates caput populorum sub uno tamen summo capite praeterea cum hoc capite agatur de hierarchia ecclesiastica multo aptius diceretur vicarius christi hoc loco supremus ecclesiae rector aut hierarcha quam caput sic enim metaphoram fugimus quod doctrina quoad ejus fieri potest servandum est totius comparationis decorum servamus dum sequentia antecedentibus quadrant praeterea illud gravius est quod subjungitur cujus dispensatione c laeditur namque imprimis ecclesiae jus nam tempore schismatis quando concilium congregatum existentibus variis ambiguis pontificibus potest ipsum concilium divino jure omnia ecclesiae officia providere praesertim quae fuerint necessaria ad pacem ecclesiae componendam vacante etiam sede si oporteret aliquod ecclesiae officium inteterea provideri sine dubio dispensatio summi pontificis non expectaretur laeditur quo que episcoporum jus ad quorum providentiam usque ab apostolis minorum officiorum dispensatio pertinuit inconsulto romano pontifice laeditur tandem jus patronatus omnium laicorum principum magistratuum secularium qui si eorum officiorum quorum sunt patroni dispensatio distributio ad summum pontificem jure divino pertineret coargui possent quasi divina jura irrupissent si inconsulto romano pontifice unum quodlibet ecclesia officium dispensarent itaque concilio quod paratur ad schismata scandala ecclesiae tollenda non debet doctrina tradi quae etiamsi vera esset apperit manifestam viam ut nova schismata scandala oriantur adde huc quod cum haec clausula quasi de facto loquatur videtur probare usum quotidianum officiis distribuendis quem emendatiorem ecclesia dei hodie desiderat postremo si ingenue fateri volumus quod verum est nec de facto nec de jure dispensatione romani pontificis omnibus membris officia distribuuntur non de facto quidem quum manifestissime constat multa ecclesiae officia legitime per alios quam per summum pontificem administrari de jure vero ante omnia exploratum est quod retro diximus post apostolos multo tempore optimo jure sine summo pontifice non officia minora modo verum majora fuisse administrata nec damnari potest antiquitas tanquam romani pontificis potestatem usurpaverit item cum haec causa inter episcopos summum pontificem fuerit aliquando controversa nonnulli menses ex conventione episcopis contigerunt quibus si officia ecclesiastica distribuant jure suo utuntur falso igitur doctrina traderet omnibus ecclesiae membris dispensatione romani pontificis officia distribui praeterquam quod potestas vicario christo collata edificationem est non destructionem pro ratione evangelio non contra rationem evangelium fieri autem non potest ut unus summus pontifex omnibus membris ubique toto orbe officia sua recte convenienter distribuat nullo igitur pacto credendum est christo accepisse potestatem quam rite ad ecclesiae utilitatem administrare non potest accepit nempe claves regni coelorum quare ea poterit quae regnum coelorum apperiunt non ea quae regnum coelorum claudunt ejusdem propemodum farinae est illa altera clausula eodem capite postremo insigniter desipiunt dei regulas confundunt c illa item inferiorum haec divina potestas ad eos potius divina institutione spectare videatur c quo doctrina omne jus patronatus aboletur quorumcunque principum aliorum laicorum deinde jus ecclesiarum eligendi sibi praelatos alia officia multa tollitur quo tamen jure olim universae ecclesiae fruebantur et nunc etiam aliquae utuntur non itaque ad episcopos hujusmodi electio aut nominatio divino jure pertinet nec eminenter ad summum pontificem quod si diceretur confirmatio electionis ad episcopos summum pontificem spectare re haberet probabilitatem quandam sed quod electio nominatio divina institutione pertineat ad episcopos summum pontificem ne verisimile quidem est sunt autem praeter aliae causae propter quas cum haec tum illa superior clausula sit expungenda prima causa est quod hujusmodi doctrina quae videlicet clausulis traditur est importuna tempori quo de recipiendis lutheranis ecclesia angitur parturit donec si fieri potest reformetur christus illis nulla autem doctrina concilio prodire posset quae eorum animos magi abalienaret nec ulla alia est quae illis plures occasiones calumniandi obloquendi suppeditaret itaque abstinendum est praesentia ab ea doctrina quae cum maxime invidiosa lutheranis sic minime catholicis est necessaria secunda causa est quod illa doctrina est importuna loco cum enim duplex sit ecclesia potestas altera ordinis altera jurisdictionis hierarchia quidem quae ex diversa ordinis potestate constituitur hujus locus propria est ubi de ordinis sacramento agitur illa vero jurisdictionis suum locum habet nempe tunc cum de ecclesiae potestate definietur id si intelligunt adversarii intelligent autem sine dubio calumniabuntur hujusmodi particulas esse doctrina obtrusas assutas aliunde industria aut astutia potius humana qua summopere abhorrere debet christiana simplicitas quae doctrina catholica populo exhibenda semper majoribus nostris servata est idque eo magi calumniabuntur adversarii si priore illa clausula considerarint de deo coelis duo solum esse posita quibus coelestis hierarchia constare videretur unum erat quod illa coelestis sub uno supremo rectore ageret alterum quod varios diversos ministrantium ordines contineret ratio autem comparationis postulabat ut ecclesiae hierarchia quae ad illius exemplar exacta terris dicitur eadem duo explicarentur quae exemplari sunt posita illud autem quod adjicitur cujus dispensatione omnibus membris c cum non fuerit coelesti illa hierarchia constitutum videtur esse terrena hierarchia praeter comparationis naturam de industria suppositum ita quae de summi pontificis potestate dignitate reliquis conciliis habentur non existimabuntur esse ex rerum consequentia definita sed vel adjecta vel intrusa obiterpatribus quasi oscitantibus dormientibus postremo causa est quod utraque re difficilis perobscura sit nec omnibus perspecta cognita indignum profecto est ut sine disputatione theologorum examine tanquam per insidias prioribus subgeratur ut nullo habito doctorum theologorum consilio de hisce rebus definiant quae magna egebant disquisitione deliberationeque quo fit ut conciliorum tradenda doctrina mirum modum labefactetur authoritas dum hujus concilii exemplo credentur ea firmiter credendum populo christiano proposuisse quae nec disquisita prius theologis sunt nec disputata testatur lucas actis apostolorum factam esse magnam conquisitionem concilio quando tamen praesidebat petrus paulus jacobus johannes intererant quod si apostoli etiam levi quae illis erat per revelationem explorata priusquam definirent adhibuerunt disquisitionem non parvam quam absurdum est bone deus ut doctrina ingeratur concilio valde difficile nulla praecedente doctorum theologorum disquisitione tota igitur illa doctrina est de hoc loco tollenda ut vera esset ne vera quidem est quantum animi nostri conjectura colligere possumus nec existimet quisquam apostolicae sedis invidiam haec dictum esse illam nempe si qui maxime veneramur quinetiam ut hujus sanctissimae sedis dignitatem authoritatem tueamur nimirum quam christo jure optimo vendicat nolumus quicquam ecclesia doceri quo hujusmodi authoritas contaminetur contaminatur autem si aut ementiti aut certe ambigui humanae potestatis tituli cum veris certisque divinis per hominum prudentiam confundantur igitur qui illam doctrinam volebat ingerere apostolicae dignitatis violator existimandus est no potius defensores tractatus alter ejusdem vargae contra eandem clausulam e manuscripto editus haec doctrina definit multum quia dum plurimum intenta est statuenda hierarchia secundum jurisdictionem nil statuit hierarchia ecclesiastica ex parte ordinis quae maxime impugnatur ab haereticis vere sacer principatus undecunque respiciamus est hoc sufficeret declarare ad confutationem haereticorum praeterea cum nihil sit disputatum de modo istius hierarchiae quantum ad jurisdictionem supremae hierarchiae nec canonibus aliquid de eo discernatur videtur importune satis hic tractari praeterea quod catholicos non aedificat haec clausula ecclesiae adversariis multum dabit scandalum imo doctis piis viris quare nec loco nec tempori videtur servire imo multum nocere posset si sic poneretur ideo judicio meo supersedendum omnino esset ab hujusmodi determinatione tollendamque omnino hanc clausulam censerem de qua rectum judicium absque longa diligenti tractatione sanctum synodus dare non debet neque potest quod si quis intendens calumniam dicat quid ergo tu dubium revocas summi pontificis potestatem quasi re esset quae novo egeret scrutinio absit imo sentio cum ecclesia catholica esse christi petri legitimum successorem ecclesiae praesidentem modus tamen usus suae potestatis variis vario modo intelligitur quidem sine fidei catholicae praejudicio illud vero quod clausula hac dicitur affirmatur ad usum modum se extendere non solum ad statuendam potestatem quis non videt quare non est ut dixi quod sic perfunctorie re tractetur alioqui gravis inter doctores catholicos controversa quod ne quis putet id gratis dici extremis ut aiunt digitis clausulae sensum attingam principio comparatio ista quae fit dei ad summum pontificem hierarchiae principatu ut hic ponitur multis posset videri immodica insolens non multum christiana nec evangelica ideo quodam modo ingrata deo videri possit qui maximos suae ecclesiae praesidentes ministros voluit nominare esse qui major inter vos erit minister c adde quod plus videtur tribuere summo pontifici quam deo nam deum appellat summum rectorem pontificem autem summum supremum caput imo plus videtur dicere qui dicit summum caput quam qui summum rectorem nam qui capitis nomen tribuit subinde tribuere videtur regimen influentiam superioritatem absolute necessariam dependentiam colligantiam omnium membrorum inferiorum ad ipsum qui autem rectorem dicit solum docet superintendentiam superioritatem item cum christus sit caput supremum ecclesiae militantis sicut triumphantis ipse nempe movet influit thurismata gratiarum atque donorum ecclesia per spiritum sanctum suum qui ea praesidet ipse baptizat ungit consecrat ordinat facit presbyteros episcopos hanc visibilem politiam ipse statuit quantum ad principaliora sua membra attendite vos inquit paulus episcopis provinciae ephesinae universo gregi vestro quo posuit vos spiritus sanctus episcopos regere ecclesiam dei consequitur christum proprie vere per se caput unicum supremum ecclesiae visibilis esse ephes ipsum dedit caput super omnem ecclesiam quae est corpus ipsius plenitudo ejus qui omnia omnibus adimplet si igitur ipse est supremum caput ecclesia militante quomodo absolute sine limitatione dici potest quod summus pontifex habeatur pro uno supremo capite pugnat nempe pluralitas cum unitate duo suprema sine limitatione dici nequaquam potest maxime quando comparatio est inter deum creaturam inter dominum servum inter summum hierarcham ministrum fugienda ergo sunt illa vocabula quae scriptura sanctis antiquis patribus non leguntur ut scandalo possint esse infirmis ecclesiae adversariis ne sanctum pontificatus nomen apud vulgus suum magi traducant quam huc usque traduxerunt dicentes pro sui ingenii pervicacia summum pontificem cum christo de primatu contendere praeterea falsum aliquibus valde videtur quod sicut deus praesidet coelesti herarchia ita papa ecclesiastica nam deo sic dependent omnia ut si ipse non esset omnia nihilum redigerentur nec haberent illius hierarchiae partes esse neque ordinem eo quod pro arbitrio ejus mutari possunt si ille volet everti ipse dixit facta sunt c non sic hierarchia ecclesiastica nam papa defuncto imo licet per tempus absens existeret aut sedes vacaret ordines tamen thurismata mansissent ecclesia nec subinde prorsus rueret subverteretur ecclesiastica politia adde quod pro arbitrio suo subvertere non posset episcopatum aut presbyteratum ordines ecclesia ex quo deo visibiliter status isti sunt constituti adde etiam quod cum potestas ipsius sit ministerialis ad ecclesiae regimen externum nec non ipsius ecclesiae utilitatem deo collata certis regulis certis limitibus repagulis debere contineri nemo qui evangelium antiquitatem ecclesiae novit ignorat dedit nempe deus illi sicut aliis apostolis potestatem non ad destructionem sed ad aedificationem ut apostolus docet cor c ad haec cum secundum multos catholicos doctores papa incorrigibilis ecclesiae manifestus dilapidator est corrigi possit contumacia ab ipsa ecclesia synodo generali deponi quomodo regimine sic indistincte comparari deo potest cum ille idem ipse sit anni ejus non deficiunt nec est qui possit ei sua hierarchia resistere hic vero possit ab hominibus disciplina contineri et quod propter haeresim hoc possit fieri ab omnibus asseritur theologis tandem sua hierarchia judicatur quae haec statuit eum exequi jure possit praeterea cum casu mortis aut longae absentiae papae aut schismatis synodus generalis illa potestate quam immediate deo habet creaverit episcopos deposuerit ordines alia officia distribuerit uti concilio chalcedonensi constantiensi aliis generalibus synodis provincialibus etiam legimus esse factum synodus nempe x toletana deposuit episcopum bracharensem etiam concilium triburiense deposuit alium non ergo tam exacte ista dependent dispensatione summi pontificis ut hic ponitur constat quoque ex ecclesiae antiquitate juxta generalium conciliorum antiqua instituta multis provinciis episcopos promotos esse cum electione cleri assensu populi finitimorum episcoporum maxime metropolitani nullo habito recursu ad primam sedem ut patet ex synodo toletana xii orientalibus ecclesiis antequam vitio schismatis laborarent quomodo ergo stare potest clausula illa cujus dispensatione singula officia c accedit quod licet designatio particularis persona ad episcopatum fateamur semper ab eo dependisse simul cum materiae limitatione prout modo fit tamen ordo ipse episcopatus pariter potestas jurisdictio eo ipso quod episcopus designatur ecclesia applicatur deo immediate habere multi docti affirmant quare quod ad tale jus consequitur etiamnum habebitur habebit plane quamvis subordinatum summo pastori non quidem ad libitum suum sed pro utilitate ecclesiae moderatum episcopus ergo divino jure distribuit officia beneficia ordines ecclesia sua cui praeficitur postquam praefectus est nec potest sine causa jure hoc quia divinum est episcopus abdicare non videtur ergo clausula illa eo modo quo jacet simpliciter vera esse quare propter haec quae magi ac magi si opus fuerit corroborabuntur alia quae consulto ut brevitati studeam omitto clausula haec videtur mihi omnino doctrina expungenda quod si tantum arridet hierarchiam ecclesiasticam tum quantum ad ordinem tum etiam quantum ad jurisdictionem attinet statuere quod mihi etiam valde gratum est sub hoc tenore videtur mihi
