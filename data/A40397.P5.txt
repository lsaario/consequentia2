upon promotion address two letter following one king prince serenissimo jacobo magnae britanniae regi illustri urbanus p p viii serenissime rex salutem lumen divinae gratiae scotiae regnum quod inclytos terris reges sanctissimosque coelo cive peperit cum ad cardinalatus nostri patrocinium pertinuerit laetitiae simul ac moeroris uberem nobis materiam afferebat exultabamus gaudio cogitautes ea regione quam romanorum arma expugnare omnino non potuerunt romanae ecclesiae fidem feliciter triumphasse scotorumque regem nullum hactenus extitisse qui pontificiae authoritatis hostis obierit enim vertebatur luctum cythara nostra cum ad praesentium temporum miserias oculos lachrymis manantes converteremus videmini enim laborante discordiarum patre obliti esse eum qui nutrivit vos contristati nutricem vestram hierusalem quare apostolica sedes quae populos istos jampridem christo genuit moerore conficitur dum tam praeclaram haereditatem verti videt ad extraneos damnique sui magnitudinem britannorum regum laudibus istarumque provinciarum gloria metitur id vero praeter caetera dolendum orbi christiano videtur jacobum regem catholicorum regum prolem sanctissimae parentis filium pontifice maximo atque majoribus suis religionis cultu dissentire si enim sublime istud ingenium quod literarum studiis prudentiae artibus rex celeberrimus excoluisti affulgenti patri luminum assentiretur facile conjicit christiana respublica quanto publicae concordiae bono factum esset ut nationes istas insulasque aut montium claustris aut oceani gurgitibus dissitas scoticus rex imperi conjungeres videtur enim majestas tua ob eam rem facta esse tot provinciarum domina ut ab eo cui parent facilius celeriusque regna ista medelam ac salutem acciperent quare assiduis precibus jam tum eum venerabamur qui dat salutem regibus ut tot divinae clementiae beneficia quibus conspectu potentium admirabilis e ad britanniae incolumitatem ecclesiae gaudium conferret affulsit autem nobis non ita pridem beata spes oriens ex alto cum te austriacae affinitatis cupidum cognovimus ex catholica matre progigni exoptantem eos qui tuam haereditatem adire populosque istos ditione tenere debent proin vix dici potest quod nobis solatium obtulit sanctissimae recordationis pontifex gregorius xv praedecessor noster dum no eorum cardinalium coetum ascivit quos anglicani matrimonii causam cognoscere voluit enituit nobis tantum negotium dissidentibus singularis quaedam propensio majestatem tuam cujus cum faveremus laudibus foelicitati etiam consultum cupiebamus nunc autem cum per apostolici senatus suffragia ad hanc stationem pervenimus ubi pro omnibus terrarum regibus excubandum est non satis explicare possumus quantum nobis cura desiderium sit magnae britanniae ac tanti regis dignitas divinitus vero accidisse videtur ut primae literae quae nobis b petri sede regnantibus redderentur eae fuerint quas praedecessori nostro nobilissimus carolus walliae princeps scripserat testis suae romanos pontifex voluntatis nunc autem cum venerabile illud conjugium benedicente domino perfici cupiamus alloqui te decrevimns nullis majestatis tuae literis expectatis charitas enim pontificii imperii decus est quamvis sede hac potentissimorum regum obsequiis cultus commoremur magnificum tamen nobis existimamus suadente charitate ad humiles etiam preces descendere dum anima christo lucremur primum ergo credere omnino te volumus nullum esse orbe christianum principem quo plura expectare possis paternae benevolentiae documenta quam pontifice maximo qui te desideratissimum filium apostolicae charitatis brachiis complecti cupit scimus quibus te litoris nuper ad tantum decus adipiscendum excitavit gregorius xv cum ejus locum venerimus ejus te propensionem non imitabimur solum sed etiam superabimus speramus enim nuntios britannia propediem allatum iri qui majestatem tuam rei catholicae favere testentur catholicosque isthic commorantes quos pater misericordiarum asseruit libertatem filiorum dei poenarum formidine liberatos regali tandem patrocinio perfrui remunerabitur ille qui dive est misericordia ejusmodi consilium illustri aliqua felicitate tum nomini majestatis tuae plaudent regna terrarum militabunt acies coelestis exercitus frendant licet dentibus suis peccatores minetur seditione potens impietas sperat europa se visuram jacobum regem romana ecclesia triumphantem majorum suorum exempla novis pietatis operibus augentem non diffidimus adesse jam tempus divini beneplaciti quo illi qui britannicae religionis laudes monumentis consignant non semper alterius seculi facta loquentur sed praesentis etiam principatus decora consequentibus aetatibus proponere poterunt ad imitandum majores illi tui te vocant qui tibi tantae claritudinis potentiae haereditatem reliquerunt qui coelestis regni fore pontificiis clavibus generi humano patefieri crediderunt certe fieri non potest ut majestas tua tot saeculorum fidem regum de te praeclare meritorum judicium aut contemnere audeat aut condemnare nonne vides sententia majestatis tuae ii omnino coelum eripi qui tibi regnum reliquerunt dum eos religionis cultu aberrasse contendis ita fieret ut quos universa ecclesia cive coeli cohaeredes christi aeterna patria dominari credit tu ex ipsorum sanguine prognatus tuo suffrragio e coelo detraheres atque errorum abyssum poenarum carcerem detruderes nonne sentis tanti cogitatione facinoris ingrati animi tui viscera perhorrescere nonne ejusmodi consiliis regalis ingenii indoles reclamitat quam tamen tot europae nationes dum ab apostolica sede dissentit reprehendere coguntur alliciat oculos tuos tantae gloriae splendor quae tibi e coelo caput ostentat manum porrigit sanctuarium dei britannos reges per te reductura comitantibus angelis hominibusque plaudentibus jacebat olim orbe terrarum deformata aerumnis christiana religio tyrannorum mina expavescens eam vero non solum e latibulis eduxit sed ad imperium etiam
