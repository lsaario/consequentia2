expectation worth math half sum b may demonstrate likewise investigate rule suppose value expectation x former principle x purchase good expectation fair game suppose play another term every one stake x gainer give loser game appears rate equal hazard either get lose game gain case get stake must pay worth b equal hazard get b therefore making math value expectation demonstration easie math play another stake math condition gainer give loser mean equal expectation get lose b win last case get ab stake must pay playfellow number equal hazard get proposition expectation worth certain may chance play another every one stake gainer pay loser fair way gaming evident equal hazard get lose gain prop ii expect b c either equal facility may happen value expectation math third part sum b c investigation suppose x value expectation x must purchase expectation game suppose condition game playing two others u stake x bargain one gamesters win give b shall gain shall give c vice versa fair play equal hazard get b first win c second gain self get viz stake give one b c equal equal expectation b c therefore making math value expectation method find equal hazard get b c value expectation math fourth part sum b c c prop iii number chance fall p number chance b fall q supposing chance happen equal facility value expectation math e product multiplied number chance added product b

pxqx every one play equal hope winning many fellowgamesters number stand make bargain one one whoever gain shall give b win shall every one rest gamesters whose number p1 make bargain whoever gain shall give shall give every one much gain evident fair play man injurd case q expectation gain b p1 expectation gain expectation viz win self get pxqxbqapa deliver b every one q player every one p1 gamesters make abpaa therefore qxbxbaapa equal would p expectation since p1 expectation q expectation b would come first expectation therefore putting pxqxbqapaa math number chance gain rule hazard worth multiplied give two added make divided easily shew come like expectation playing four others every one u staking two make bargain whoever gain shall give shall two make bargain whoever gain shall give much gain appears mean two expectation get viz first two gain expectation get viz either two gain case gain stake obligd give first two two remains self prop iv may come question proposd viz making distribution amongst gamesters hazard unequal must begin easie case suppose play another condition win three first game shall stake already gaind two would know agree break game part stake justly much fall share first thing must consider question number game wanting example agreed betwixt u stake gaind first game gaind already fellowgamester hazard much better case proposed viz game case there wanting next place find portion stake due u must consider would happen game went certain gain first game get stake call gaind lot would equal would fall u since equal hazard gain lose first game equal expectation gain first proposition much worth half sum e left fellowgamester whence follows would buy game ought pay therefore undertakes gain one game another gain two may wager prop v suppose want one game fellowgamester three required make distribution stake let u likewise consider state gaind first game gain stake want yet game therefore condition supposed former proposition would fall share demonstrated therefore equal facility may happen first proposition worth fellowgamester left therefore hazard calculation former proposition requisite serve following suppose self want one game fellow four method find stake belongs prop vi suppose want two game fellowgamester three next game happen want one three preceding proposition worth want two whence due u equal probability gain lose next game equal hazard gain first proposition worth eleven part stake due five fellow prop vii let u suppose want two game fellow four gain next game shall want one fellow four lose shall want two three equal hazard gaining first worth appears gain two game others four better condition gain one others two share first case le share last prop viii let u suppose three gamesters whereof first second want game third find share first must consider would happen either two gaind first game gain stake second gain nothing third gain would want game would due every one thus first gamester one expectation gain one gain nothing one since equal probability gain first game second proposition worth since second gamesters condition good share likewise remains third whose share might easily found self prop ix number gamesters please amongst want fewer game find one share stake must consider would due whose share investigate either fellowgamesters gain next following game add share
