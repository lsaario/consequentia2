imputed righteousnesse justified workes abraham faith imputed righteousnesse therefore abraham justified workes proposition thus proved worketh fulfilleth law righteousnesse imputed reckoned grace debt worketh doth fulfill law beleeveth justifieth sinner hee acknowledgeth himselfe therefore merit nothing punishment faith counted imputed righteousnesse example abraham bellarmine notably

justification saint iames speaking second justification saith man justified workes faith onely apostle use example abraham proofe assertion paul proving man justified god faith without workes
