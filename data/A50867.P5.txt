lock observation expositor agreed death god threatned adam upon eating forbidden fruit mr lock mistake death understand nothing call death body natural temporal death believe deny death threatned word thou shalt surely die gen 2 17 great objection mr lock intimate viz said day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die whereas nine hundred year eating adam died death hereto may answerd 1 day eat taking word strict sense death became due became child death god might said solomon abiathar 1 king 2 26 thou art worthy death time put thee death 2 day became liable disease harbinger death degree weaken strength nature last introduce death 3 st hierom theodoret testifie symmachus instead thou shalt surely die translates thou shalt mortal rendring approvd commended hierom tradit hebr gen according difficulty adam become mortal day 4 say adam repented upon repentance execution threatning respited others say respited upon account remedy god prepared viz seed woman lastly necessity word day taken strictly may understand largely viz time thou shalt eat thereof know assuredly thou shalt die death solomon say shimei day thou goest passest brook kidron thou shalt know certain thou shalt surely die 1 king 2 37 could solomon meaning shimei surely die day passed kidron could foresee shimei would return jerusalem self day word would brought self day passed tell shimei pas would forfeit life certainly put death whensoever please give order execution sentence therefore notwithstanding forementiond objection may conclude adam die death call death body natural death thus far mr lock right question whether right say death threatned gen 2 17 understand nothing death think death affliction outward suffering calamity may comprehended word death gen 2 word death taken sense place scripture paul say death oft may interpret suffering oft see 2 cor 11 23 like manner say 1 cor 15 31 die daily may suppose respect affliction suffering came daily upon sake christ plainly word thus

perfect righteousness true holiness light strength adam fall likewise everlasting death conceive comprehended penalty threatned gen 2 mr lock disputed perhaps considerd argument may said doth argue make everlasting death comprehended threatning call eternal death call eternal life misery word seems strange way understanding law requires plainest directest word death meant eternal life misery could one supposd law say felony shall die lose life kept alive perpetual exquisite torment thus mr lock reasonab christian p 5 labouring expose make double death body soul temporal also eternal threatend adam cannot said argues nothing look like argument 1 say strange death meant eternal life misery instead eternal life misery said eternal death misery life perpetual exquisite torment misery truly death life margin bible gen 2 17 instead thou shalt surely die hath dying thou shalt die word seem properly express men dying everlastingly 2 cannot say doth say believe would said say felony thou shalt die cannot supposd mean lose life kept alive perpetual exquisite torment case parallel expound word thou shalt surely die double death say lose depart present life also departure suffer perpetual exquisite torment besides earthly lawgiver kill body say thou shalt die cannot supposed mean person suffer torment cannot inferrd hence heavenly lawgiver hath killd able destroy soul body hell say thou shall die may fitly supposd threaten eternal death well temporal give greatest offence still behind describes call natural temporal death losing action lise sense also ceasing word death understand nothing ceasing losing action life sense see reasonab christian p 6 p 15 case whoever guilty sin certainly die cease men die body lose action life sense need told ceasing quite different
