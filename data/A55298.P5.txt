rebus ipsis per re ipsas quandoquidem esse rerum de se est semper verum essentia illarum est ipsamet veritas adeoque intellectus qui super ea fertur semper directe est verus sed cum imaginatio ejusve ratio sit modus quidam intelligendi obliquus procedens per rationes discursus non autem per adaequationis transformationem idcirco modus iste rationalis est intellectus abusivus fallax bonum autem rectum unum verum semper uno eodem modo se habent intellectu quia intellectu stant puncto adaequationis sed malum curvum obliquum falsum atque multiplex fiunt pluribus modis per rationem parte imaginativa certo itaque cognovi rationem non tam sublimi pretio habendam ac fuit hactenus magisque quod brutis ratio discursus non obscure vigerent nam quod annosa vulpes callidior sit juniore per discursum rationalem experientae reminiscentia confirmatum accidit imo ape numerant s agnovi valedicendum rationi imaginationi tanquam facultatibus brutalibus si ad solidam veritatis cognitionem spe trahamur profundum cognovi pariter quod requireretur facilis traductio intellectus atque transmutatio placida sui ipsius formam rei intelligibilis quo puncto scilicet intellectus pro momento fiat velut ipsum intelligibile cum autem intellectus perficiatur intelligendo nihilque perficiatur nisi ab eo quod symbolum secum habet sui natura idcirco collegi intellectum intellecta ut talia debere esse aut fieri ejusdem naturae debere autem hoc fieri extra laborem inquietudinem sed cum otio lumine sibi proprio cum abstractione orbatione carentia alterius cujuscunque auxilii creati s istud lumen sive sit prorsus supernaturale sive quod intellectus sui natura sic accendatur malim experiri quam determinare istud unicum saltem scio quod non contingat absque gratia quamobrem sive intellectus transformetur sive se ipsum transformet simulacrum rei intellectae sane divino auxilio opus habet quidem singulari quia saltem tunc anima intuetur suum intellectum sub forma arrepta dicto lumine atque isto sui speculo speculatur se ipsam intellectualiter absque reflexione alteritatis sicque concipit rem scibilem una cum omni suo esse proprietatibus eo quod hoc cognitionis lumen non sit emanativum extra intellectum sed manet intus reflexum super intellectum omni veritate certitudine perfecta perfectivum s ispa rei intelligibilitas est nisi adventus approximatio unitatis intellectus intellecti c quod ut clarius exemplo fiat intelligens intellectus non est diversus ab intellecto aliter quam sicut radius lucis directus se ipso reflexo itaque rei intellectae essentia lumine intellectus fit splendor spiritualis essentialis imo fit per commigrationem ad unitatem quodammodo ipsum lumen intellectuale id quod animabus brutorum advenire nequit ideo etiam anima nostra se ipsam intelligens quod ammodo intelligit omnia alia utpote universa alia sunt intellectuali modo anima ut dei imagine c idcirco quantum anima intellectualiter intilligit sui tantum proficit cognitione utilissima quae de creatis hac vita haberi possit quia lumine sui luminis quodammodo intuetur omnium proprietates essentias effectus alteritates distinctiones atque defectus quo igitur semel appulit ista cognitio ibidem flaccescit omnis rationis nubilior speculatio subsidium prout vice versa supprimitur verus intellectus sub rationis placitis s ostendi sat alias tota natura aristotelis doctrinam inanem merasque nugas quanto ergo minus ille subsisteret area intellectus cujus esse operari pendent ex sola anima cogimur namque christiani credere quod intellectus noster sit spiritus immortalis lumen imago omnipotentis cujus exordium ut superat naturam itae ejus regulis aptari nequit cum habeat esse simplicissimum tum etiam quod dep ndeat immediate totaliter continuo suo originali typo adeoque ut sine gratia particulari nequeat quicquam intelligere eo quod intellectus objectum sit ipsa veritas quare nec intelligit intellectione perfecta nisi recipiendo quod autem tantum recipit id patitur non autem eo agit nec enim intellectui proprium illud est quod per gratiam illi advenit quippe intellectus tantum illuminative intelligendo patitur est namque molestius servilius obscurius intelligendo operari quam pati eo quod patiendo recipiat lumen nobilius grate collatum denique cum intelligendo transmigret semper formam rei intellectae ergo participans de lumine interminato perficitur absque taedio

essent et apertae ergo semper perficitur intellectus patiendo recipiendoque s ego credo imprimis nil ad veritatis cognitionem pertingere nisi fidem intellectum omnem veritatem emanare ex veritate unica ideoque primitiva omnen intellectum ex unico infinitoque intellectu derivare prout omne lumen ex unico lumine veritatis ideo essentiam nil discrepare ab essentia intellectus quod intellectus
