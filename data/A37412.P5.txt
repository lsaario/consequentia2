unquam antea jucunditate recreabit ac de hactenus quod vero ad nostra negotia attinet perveni huc die julii sub vesperam ac statim adivi illustrissimum dominum nuncium cui vestras tradidi quas laeto vultu accipere visus est sed colloquendi non fuit otium cum parata coena jam discumbere vellet posteriorem diem igitur rejectus ad dominum carpionem conferebam cum didici eum ad vos missum quatriduo ante hinc discessisse dolui admodum eum non esse mihi obviam factum tum ratione vestrarum tum mearum literarum quoniam fasciculum quendam ad quoque ferebat sed quod maxime torquebat erat cura de litteris illustrissimi domini rosenbergii quas sciebam inclusas domini carpionis literis nec ea aperire aut alii tradere audebam cum diserte esset scriptum illud ad manus proprias dum itaque occasionem quero expecto ea sese obtulit quam mox audietis reversus sequenti die ad illustrissimum dominum nuncium invenio apud illum jesuitam italum qui mihi fuit confessionibus blande ambobus accipior sedere jubeor jesuita nomine candoris ingenuitatis non parum laudor tum lupide moneor ab illustrissimo domino nuncio ut ipsi adsim convertendo jesuita ille enim erat qui cum ipso expostulaverat quod nimis facile mihi dedisset testimonia triumphantis ecclesiae non subjici judicio militantis respondeo fecisse quod erat ut docerem eum praeferre coelum terrae ac tribunal superius inferiori sed cum id mihi minime successet ejus esse sua doctrina autoritate hominem de sententia illa dejicere illustrissimus dominus nuncius haud gravate nostram sententiam hac parte probat exemplis confirmat atque ita concludit ut statuat certitudinem videntis audientis dominum aut ejus angelum non pendere probatione ecclesiastica neque ab illo esse rationem repetendam suae revelationis dum nihil publici muneris exercere audet sed si incipiat palam profiteri se deo doctum missum ita ut non solum sed aliorum quoque intersit scire quo spiritu agatur tunc ecclesiasticorum munus esse illius spiritum examinare probare neque ipsum jure posse examen hoc detrectare licet suas revelationes eis subjicere minime teneatur nam si ordinaria autoritas eum admiserat bene habebit nihilque turbarum excitabitur sin per injuriam aut inscitiam ali quam aut per aliam hujusmodi causam rejicietur suum erit appellare superiorem dominum qui ipsum misit quo suum servum legatum defendat aut ordinario judice commonefacto aut alia ratione quod probabat decreto lateranense concilii cujus mentionem facit suis literis ac praeterea historia francisci qui primum expulsus ab innocentio pontifice mox revocatus fuit cum per quietem apparuisse pontifici pannosus ille qui lateranense templum suis humeris fulciret addebat praeterea viros dei non esse solitos deterreri una aut altera repulsa hoc repellendi modo dicebat praesules aliquando usos esse ut probarent spiritum constantiam eorum qui re nova magnasque proponerent ego vero inquam ut haec ita se habeant vos hactenus publicum munus exercere non tentasse intra privatos paries summa modestia vos continuisse tum ille longiori ambitu verborum sic de vobis disserint ut ex vestris verbis serenissimum poloniae regem ad invictssimun caesarem ad illustrissimum legatum hispanicum jam constare diceret vos aliquid amplius quam privatum moliri ac summo pontifici sedenti speculum super totam christianam rempublicam potuisse merito suspectas esse vestras persona hoc modo principum animos interiores aularum recessus scrutantes idque ratione vestrae regnae infensissimae apostolicae sedi cum ipso turca conspirantis necnon spiritus familiares habentis ac praeterea ratione vestrae summae peritiae artibus scientiis reconditis quibus facile plebi imperitis imponi potest cum enim sitis magni astrologi dicebat ille facile vobis sit habere genesis principum necnon magicas artes calleatis haud difficulter possetior bonorum angelorum nomine ea proponere quae spiritu ecclesiae hoste manarent ideo summum pontificem cui duo illi principe sunt maxime observandi utpote qui inter haereticos vivant regnent prudenter fecisse qui jusserit ut vestros more doctrinam inquireretur accidisse autem praeter ejus postulatam voluntatem ut indicta causa expelleremini se vero vicem nostram dolere paratum esse ad curandum ut vos justificare possitis idque sibi esse votis non semel asserint quapropter hortatus est ut ad illustrissimum dominum rosenbergium contenderem que ipsius bonam propensionem erga vos ei significarem nam ille summo pontifice facile impetrabit ut causa vestra hic cognoscatur si ille vobis faverit ut hactenus

inhumaniter hospitiis civitatibus ratione hujus praejudicii caesarei tractaremini doceo quam sordido angusto loco vestras familias reliqueritas ita ut vestram supellectilem libros explicare nequi

cum hisce mitto et quia legendi ea mihi copiam satis jejunias frigidas mihi esse visus haud tamen quia mentionem aliquam mei facit tanquam hominis quo fusius de suo animo erga vos egerit visum est mihi accurate particulatim exponere quid inter no actum dictumve sit ut verba cum factis conferre possitis pro vestra prudentia pietate consilium capere si operae precium videbitur rescribere quantum enim ex ejus sermonibus colligo videtur ipsi necessarium novum mandatum summo pontifice antequam quicquam vobiscum agat nec se scripturum dicit de vobis romam nisi prius petatis quod ab ejus sanctitate capitis utpote qui hac causa fuerit merus interpres inter pontificem caesarem nec possit nisi verbis sui domini quicquam promittere statuere idcirco quantum videre possum re diutius protrahetur quam vellemus nisi dominus noster pontifex coelestis alio modo nobis providerit die inveni illust rosenbergium tam occupatum ut admitti non potuerim sed per cubicularium significavit se valde cupere ut colloqueremur itaque redirem die interim fui rursus cum illustrissimo nuncio mox discessuro ad sancti carolus monasterium ubi commorabitur quamdiu hi estus saevient et cum commodo cecidisset colloquendo visum est mihi interrogare hominem probaret meam sententiam de discernendo ex certis notis terminis verum verbum dei ficto fucato cum possit angelus malus transformare se angelum lucis apostata falsi non raro se transfigurent apostolos christi dicebam enim duo mihi videri necessaria ut hoc judicium rite fiat primum quidem homine audiente bona propensio animus bene affectus ad creatorem totusque ex ei ita pendens ut nihil antiquius habeat quam ei placere qui de ejus benignitate atque veritate non dubitet erga eos qui ad ipsum confugiunt ut bonum spiritum hauriant deinde sermone nomine dei proposito requiri ea proprietates quae tantum authorem deceant quas graphice describit paulus cum dicit vivus est enim sermo dei efficax penetrabilior omni gladio ancipiti perlingens usque ad divisionem animae ac spiritus compagum quoque ac medullarum discretor cogitationum intentionum cordis non est ulla creatura invisibilis conspectu ejus cui adstipulatus deus qui apud jeremiam dicit propheta qui somnium habet somnium narret et qui verba mea habet verba mea narret quid paleis cum tritico dicit dominus nunquid non verba mea sunt quasi ignis dicit dominus quasi malleus conterens petram concludebam igitur hominem deo fidentem ex efficacitate ardore illo quo affici se percipit deprehendere sermonis dei veritatem nam vox lupi alieni pastoris non potest permovere veram ovem ut ipsum diu sequatur hanc esse regulam qua judicarem divinas sententias non divinis distingui posse ille probabit meam sententiam atque addidit sine bono studio auditorum non apparere efficacitatem divinorum sermonum ut constat ex christi historia dum enim simplices israelite dicebant nunquid sic loquutus est homo similia de christi doctrina pharisaei perversi sacerdotes eum deridebant contemnebant tnnc ego si contingeret igitur ut cum congrediemur fieret ad te verbum domini num hujuscemodi regula utereris hic ille inquit cum posset accidere ut mihi de hac judicandum esset nolo hoc tempore meam sententiam declarare sed hujuscemodi ratio non mihi mala videtur ex quibus verbis nescio quid mihi visus sum adorari minus candidum quam tanta opus esset sed dei esto judicium de ejus interiori sensu ego bona fide colloquium nostra exposui ut vobis usui esse possint ratus hoc vobis gratum sicut foret mihi si vestro loco essem reversus die ad illust resenbergium vidi eum tandem exeuntem ex cubiculo ad quosdam nobiles et dixit se tantopere districtum esse ut mecum colloqui non posset sicut cuperet ego vero inquam celsitudinis monitu toties

moraretur ego jam discessurus video gregorium seorsum cum ipso colloquentem et torvo vultu intuentum saluto illum gratulor reditum ac demum de vobis incorrogo ille respondet se nihil quicquam de vobis
