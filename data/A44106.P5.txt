therefore set scheme pedigree explain nature descent hereditary succession pedigree pedigree application give plain account hereditary succession several case limitation appear ensuing rule take mark epocha father rule descent law preferrs worthiest blood upon account descent immediately male preferred female whether succession descending ascending collateral therefore son inherits excludes daughter brother preferred sister uncle aunt descent immediate descendant male preferred descendant female hence daughter eldest son preferred descent father son youngest son daughter eldest brother uncle preferred son younger uncle nay great uncle great grandfather brother shall inherit uncle mother side rule descent next blood preferred remote though equally worthy upon account sister whole blood preferred descent brother half blood strictly joyned brother whole blood viz father mother brother though otherwise worthy half blood son daughter nearer brother brother sister uncle son

father inherited died without issue eldest brother descendant inherited younger brother descendant brother sister sister descendant inherit uncle grandfather brother descendant though law england exclude father inheriting substitute directs descent father inherited viz let first next degree rule line part mother shall never inherit long though never remote line part father therefore though
