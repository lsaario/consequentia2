secundum considerationem parium suorum et dominus rex peteret ab eo quod ei emendas faceret et non fecit propositae fuerunt ei ex parte domini regis transgressiones subscriptae simul cum praedictis ut ad ea responderet ad quod respondit idem come quod ad haec nullum diem habuit sed et dixit quod ad diem certum et rationabilem satisfaceret domino regi vel inde staret ad considerationem parium suorum et petiit quod dominus rex scriptis ei ostenderet super quibus articulis tenetur respondere ad hoc respondit come quod ad singulos dy ei domino rege datos idem come venit nec aliquo quaesivit dilationem sed semper recepit diem ad voluntatem domini regis vnde videtur ei quod omnes dy ei dati postquam fuit apud kenintone pro uno die sibi debent allocari et semper paratus est stare ad

hoc paratus est facere quod pares sui considerabunt quorum quidem primus articulus hic est quod dominus rex exigit ob eo omnes exitus regni sui de quatuordecem annis continuo sequentibu post mortem iohannis regis patris sui et unde suscepit custodiam et curam sine traditione patris sui domini iohannis regis et sine assensu domini gwallae tunc legati qui de communi consensu et provisione totius regni post mortem mareschalli fuit primus consiliarius et principalis totius regni angliae ad hoc respondit quod certae persona deputatae sunt ad respondendum de exitibus regni scilicet thesaurarius et camerarii unde post mortem eustatii de faucumberg londoniensis episcopi et thesaurarii fuit quaesitum quod de computo suo responderet et fuit responsum postea carliolensi episcopo fuit quaesitus computus totius exitus regni tanquam capitali receptore et sedit ad computum petro de rivallis fuit postmodo quaesitus computus nunquam autem iusticiario debet computus requiri eo quod non est receptor exitus regni vnde videtur quod ille qui nihil recipit aliquo non tenetur respondere et dicit quod dominus iohannes rex tradidit ei iusticiariam apud runningemede coram domino stephano cantuariae archiepiscopo comite warrannae comite de ferrariis aliis magnatibus ipse toto tempore iohannis regis stetit justiciarius accidit autem quod castrum dovoriae adventu domini lodovici quasi pro derelicto habebatur quod castrum intravit quando pauci inventi fuerunt qui eodem intrare voluerunt nisi corpus ejus intrasset toto tempore guerrae castro non potuit recedere nec officium

facere quod pares sui considerabunt etiam si respondere deberet habet chartam domini regis que ipsum ab absolvit quam profert quae confecta est anno regni regis henrici decimo quinto item exigit ab eo quod ei respondeat de collectione totius quintae decimae quae per commune consilium totius regni custodiri haberi debuit deposito ita deposito quod nihil inde caperetur u que ad aetatem domini regis nisi per visum sex episcoporum sex comitum ad hoc specialiter attornatorum hoc non nisi ad defensionem regni unde summa fuit circiter quater viginti novem millia marcarum argenti ad hoc respondit quod domini sarisburiensis bathoniensis episcopi illam pecuniam receperunt per commune consilium regni inde reddiderunt computum suum inde quieti sunt per literas domini reg vnde non videtur quod inde debeat respondere et si hoc non suffi dicet aliud super hoc paratus est c habet etiam chartam regis quae ipsum c item quod respondeat de terra pictaviae de qua iohannes rex obiit seisitus unde dominus rex qui nunc est fuit seisina quando idem come suscepit custodiam regni scilicet de rupella nyorth de sancto iohanne qui quando ad rescussionem terrarum illarum mittere debuerat thesaurum denarios misit barillos lapidibus sabulone impletos et ita quod quando barones magnate domini regis burgenses videruni defaltam illam diverterunt se ab homagio servitio domini regis convertebantur ad inimicos domini regis propter quod dominus rex amisit pictaviam ad hoc respondit quod nunquam misit tale varillos de quibus dicitur hoc praecise defendit per quodcun que pares sui considerabunt sed de consilio magnatum angliae ad defensionem rupellae missi fuerunt centum milites amplius quamplures fervientes qui fuerunt cum domino rege ibidem quous que burgenses homines illius terrae diverterunt se ab homagio domini regis unde per ejus negligentiam non amittitur rupella nec per negligentiam militum ibi existentium quia illis invitis burgenses terram reddiderunt regi francorum et hoc bene patet quod cum milites domini regis essent villa burgenses amoverunt eos consilio illorum sine militibus pacem fecerunt ita quod milites salvo corpore suo hernesio possent recedere per excessus etiam e falcasii de brent falconis amittebatur rupella qui falco sui domino regi eo tempore quo rupella fuit obsessa insurrexerunt qui etiam falco per willielmum fratrem suum fecit capi henricum de braybroc justiciarium domini regis itinerantem propter quem captum alias injurias dicti falconis oportuit regem magnate terrae obsidere castrum de berefordia per consilimm archiepis oporum episcoporum magnatum terrae qui etiam episcopi ibidem excommunicaverunt falconem unde pa et manifeste delictum falconis alioqui non excommunicassent eum et si falco impune evasisset castrum non esset captum tarbatum esset regnum plusquam fuit et si hoc non sufficit c et super hoc paratus est c item de hoc respondeat quod dum dominus rex fuit infra aetatem subvenire debuit terrae pictaviae exereitus fun proficisci deberet pictavium fecit ipse come obsidere castrum betefordiae ubi dominus rex magnate sui angliae antequam illud captum esset maximam impenderunt pecuniam quo etiam capto illud prosterni fecit reddi willielmo de bello campo super quem dominus iohannes rex castrum illud ceperat per guerram unde iohannes rex seisitus fuit quando obiit ad hoc respondit quod per illum solummodo non fuit castrum obsessum sed per commune consilium regni per delictum falconis suorum quia fecit capi henricum de braybroc justiciarium domini regis per willielmum de breante fratrem suum vnde dominus rex misit literas suas eidem falconi una vice alia pro deliberando justiciario suo quod frater suus pro quibus nihil facere voluit rex etiam misit literas suas willielmo de breante qui respondit quod ipsum henricum non redderet sine falcone fratre suo quod frater suus bene advocaret quod fecit vnde dominus rex habito consilio cum magnatibus suis accessit u que berefordiam misit ad illos qui erant infra castrum petrum filium hereberti alanum basset petens quod deliberarent henricum de braybroc justiciarium suum quem tenebant imprisonatum quod venissent emendare delictum super captione dicti justiciarii domini regis et ipsi responderunt quod nihil facerent pro domino rege quod ipsum henricum tenerent si possent plus caperent unde per consilium magnatum angliae fuit castrum obsessum captum dirutum quo diruto fuit sedes castri tradita willielmo de bello campo per consilium magnatum angliae hac ratione quod forma pacis inita inter dominum regem dominum lodov tum barones continebatur quod quis que haberet talem seisinam quam habuit principio guerrae vnde dominus gwalla legatus archiepiscopus episcopi excommunicaberunt omnes qui venirent contra istam formam pacis et quia idem willielmus semper erat pe en versus dictum falconem dictum castrum jus suum nec habere potuit donec fuit captum per dominum regem idem dominus rex de consilio magnatum suorum propter formam pacis factae pro timore sententiae latae dictam sedem castri ei reddidit tenendam eodem modo quo antecessores sui tenuerunt prout paret rotulis domini regis et etiam idem willielmus dedit domino regi de suo ut tal seisinam haberet ut patet similiter rotulis domini regis et si hoc non sufficit dicet aliud et super hoc c item quod de hoc respondeat quod romam nuncio destinavit et aut quam dominus rex esset plenae aetatis imperrabit quod esset plenae aetatis si ut hoc esset ad commodum domini regis et autoritate cujus aetatis inchartari sibi fecit terras quae fuerunt h de essex et plures alias terras dignitates et libertates de quibus seisinam per se ipsum cepit post mortem ipsius regis johannis et de quibus idem rex iohannes obiit seisitus ut etiam dari fecit et confirmari viris religiosis personis ecclesiasticis et aliis multas terras et libertates et alia ad minorationem et magnam deteriorationem dignitatis domini regis et corona suae ad hoc respondit quod non destinavit nuncio romam sed episcopus wintoniensis misit romam w de sancto albano pro dicto negotio magi ad nocumentum dicti hu erti quam ad commodum suum ut ipse et alii redderent custodias suas et ita factum fuit apud northampton postea de communi consilio archiepiscopi et episcoporum provisum fuit quod dominus rex haber sigillum et currerent litterae suae ut sic majoris timoris esset regno majoris authoritatis postea impetrata fuit venia suae aetatis ad suggestionem archiepiscopi episcoporum comitum et baronum ab h orio papa suggesserunt enim papae quod prudentia et discretio sua aetatem suam supplevit sicut continetur privilegio honor papae directo comitibus et baronibus quod sic incipit ad haec et infra licet charissimi christo filli nostri henrici regis angliae illustris adolescentia computetur annis quia tamen sicut accepimus et gaudemus animum induit virilem aetate quia proficit et prudentia ita quod annorum numero sibi deest discretionis videatur recuperare virtute non est ei amodo prohibendum de regno et regni negotiis utiliter disponere ideo que per apostolica scripta mandamus quatenus cum venerabili fratre nostro episcopo wintoniensi et nobilibus viris iusticiario angliae et

per dominum papam tantummodo ipsi intendebat illam terram ei dedit per cartam etiam terram ut jus suum ei reddidit postquam venit ad pacem suam et si hoc non sufficit c paratus est super hoc c item quod respondeat de hoc quod cum dominus rex scotiae willielmus aliquando tradidisset domino iohanni regi duas filias suas unde primogenita maritari deberet domino regi vel comiti richardo si de domino rege humanitus contingeret pro quo maritagio idem rex willielmus quietum clamavit regi iohanni totum jus suum quod habuit terris cumberland westmeriland northumberland praeterea dedit ei quindecim millia argenti marcarum ipse antequam dominus rex talis esset aetatis quod posset discernere utrum ipsam v llet habere uxorem vel non desponsavit eam et ita quod cum dominus rex pervenit ad aetatem op rtuit eum dare regi scotiae qui nunc est ducentas libratas terrae pro quieta clamatione praedictarum terrarum quia primae conventiones non fuerunt observatae et hoc non obstante quod prius desponsaverat comitissam gloverniae quae aliquando desponsata fuit domino johanni regi dum fuit come quam rex johannes commisit ei custodiam cujus maritagium vendiderat aliquando galfrido de mandeville pro viginti millibus marcarum unde utra que illarum conjuncta fuit alteri consanguinitate certo gradu ad haec respondit quod de conventione inita inter duo reges scilicet de maritagio faciendo domino regi vel comiti richardo nunquam scivit sed quod per dominum regem de consilio magnatum maritari debuit de eorum consilio fuit maritata patet tam per litteras domini pandulfi tunc legati angliae quam per literas cantuariensis archiep scopi episcoporum comitum baronum nec etiam illa conventio potuit impedire si facta fuit quia quando maritata fuit rex fuit talis aetatis quod

excommunicationis generaliter lata fuit omnes malefactores illos eorum fa tore et hoc fecit dum fuit justiciarius per eum qui pacem deberet observare ita quod pax hucus que per haec extitit perturbata ad hoc respondet quod nihil scit quia per illum non fuit hoc factum quod patet manifeste quia dominus papa super hoc fecit fieri inquisitionem per episcopum wintoniensem abbatem sancti eadmundi inquisitio facta transmissa fuit ad papam per quam inquisitionem apparuit manifeste quod non fuit culpa quia si fuisset papa puniisset eum quod non fecit et si hoc non sufficit c et super hoc paratus

evaderet sine licentia ipsius domini regis ipse de prisona illa evasit cum per conventionem illam per sectam illorum de quorum custodia evasit utlagatus esset postmodum dominus rex gratiam suam illum
