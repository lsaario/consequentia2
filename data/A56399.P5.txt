investigemus oportet quid per vocem ideam no intelligere debemus platonem usum introduxisse constat de quo augustinus octaginta quaestionum libro idea primo appellasse plato perhibetur non tamen si hoc nomen antequam ipse institueret non erat ideo vel re ipsae non erant quas idea vocavit vel nullo erant intellectae sed alio fortasse atque alio nomine ab aliis atque aliis nuncupatae sunt quae quidem eminentissimi viri conjectura verisimilior ab una parte videtur ab altera minus nam philosophorum antiquissimas familias de rebus id intellexisse quod varias suas formas seu specie habeant quarum unaquaeque genus certum aeterna necessitate constituat no neutiquam dubitemus num vero eodem quo platonici modo intellexerunt nimirum prout divina intelligentia delitescunt haud immerito controvertamus neque tamen hinc ita inferendum puto quasi maximum par veterum philosophorum omnesque fere quos graecia barbaros esse voluit magi gymnosophistae druides deum aliquem extare inficiarentur atqui tanta erat de deo apud ho opinionum varietas pugna siquidem tullium amimadvertisse memini lib de nat deorum cui vero esse deos dixerunt tanta sunt varietate ac dissensione constituti ut eorum molestum sit dinumerare sententias ut ejusmodi specie tanquam divina intelligentia conversantes apprehendisse cum notitia quam attributorum divinorum habuerunt adeo imperfecta ac dimidiata esset non ita facile credendum sit quomodocunque autem rem istam se habuisse existimemus platonem terminum ipsum adinvenisse liquet mentem volebant platonici rerum esse judicem ait cicero academ quaest lib solam censebant idoneam cui crederetur quia sola cerneret id quod esset simplex uniusmodi tale quale esset hanc illi ideam appellabant jam platone ita nominatam no recte speciem possumus dicere sensus autem omnes hebetes tardos esse arbitrabantur nec percipere ullo modo re ea quae subjectae sensibus viderentur quae essent aut ita parvae ut sub sensum cadere non possent aut ita mobile concitatae ut nihil unquam unum esset constans nec idem quidem quia continenter laberentur fluerent omnia itaque hanc omnem partem rerum opinabilem appellabant scientiam autem nusquam esse censebant nisi animi motionibus atque rationibus qua de causa definitiones rerum probabant ad omnia de quibus disceptabatur adhibebant oratore etiam eandem sententiam haec idem ut igitur formis figuris est aliquod perfectum excellens cujus ad excogitatam speciem imitando referuntur ea quae sub oculos ipsa non cadunt sic perfectae eloquentiae speciem animo videmus effigiem auribus quaerimus rerum formas appellat idea ille non intelligendi solum sed etiam dicendi gravissimus autor magister plato easque gigni negat ait semper esse ac ratione intelligentia contineri eademque prorsus ab ipso alibi quin suida hesychio apuleio alexandro ab alexandro ficino platonem aliisque testibus quam plurimis accepimus atqui quamvis sit hujusce idearum disciplinae fructus ut augustinus neminem absque ea philosophum esse posse asseveraret nihilominus proximi platone philosophiae magistri illiusque ex parte institutorum haeredes aristoteles xenocrates hic generales idea genus ac specie ille exemplarium disciplinam convertendo laeserunt adeo ut mox plurimum nativae authoritatis amitteret quid quod idearum ipse venerabilis autor de ii tam incerte allegorice differeret nonlatin alphabet inquit laertius nonlatin alphabet neque vero multo post nonlatin alphabet intellige nonlatin alphabet tanta siquidem terminorum ambiguitate gestire videbatur ut insomnium moribundi platonis per quod cygnum migrasse aucupesque ex arbore arborem transvolitando defatigare sibi visus est enarrans olympiodorus simmiae socratici explicationem satis lepidam apposuerit scilicet interpretum turbam quam aucupes referre judicavit nunquam aliquando deprehensuram nonlatin alphabet ad haec nonnulli forsan istam idearum naufragii causam subnexuri sunt aristotelem acerrime seipsum opposuisse non levi profecto injuria etsi enim xenocraticis ideis hostis insensissimus esset attamen sive quod honorem habere magistro videri voluerit cum praesertim contempsisse adeo exprobrarant illi xenocratici seu quod suae generum specierum doctrinae quam expolitius idearum doctrinae genus esse censebat aut inservire aut saltem satis apte convenire perspexerit longe humanius excepisse videtur quamvis hanc aristotelis xenocraticorum litem multum officere contigit optimo tamen illius usu hominum recentiorum industria revocato illustrato penitus delere nequivit idearum hanc definitionem augustinus instituit sunt principales formae quadam vel rationes rerum stabile atque incommutabiles quae ipsae formatae non sunt ac per hoc aeternae semper eodem modo sese habentes quo divina intelligentia continentur cum qua aliorum consentiunt definitiones veruntamen id insuper adnotandum sit quod platonici de divina ipsa essentia esse docuerint cujus rei cum alcinoum qui ideam nonlatin alphabet defiinerit themistiumque ideam cum dei natura confundentem tum plotinum libro de pulchro ubi de deo disseruerit quod sit ipsa omnium idea universalis nec non proclum jamblichumque autores recepimus imo etiam ipse plato timaeo parmenide istue diserte tueri videtur autem idea si augustino credamus anima negatur intueri posse nisi rationali ea sui parte qua excellit id est ipsa mente atque ratione quasi quadam facie vel oculo suo interiore atque intelligibili cum jam compendiariam hancce idearum historiam conscripsimus deinde considerandum subit quid suas esse idea designavit cartesius quem etiamsi utpote virum definiendi peritissimum claram dilucidam significationem tradere expectandum esset nihil tamen aliud ex illo quam platonicas allusiones ac descriptiones percipimus eo scilicet viri acutissimi consilio ut cum suum super ii judicium obscurum ambiguum reliquisset exortis subinde objectionibus ad sensum sibi commodissimum interpretari liceret quam conjecturam ne injuria ac invidiose proferri existimares non ab fore videtur si nonnullas ex illius idearum definitionibus colligemus collectas inter se comparabimus tertia meditatio haec habet nunc autem ordo videtur exigere ut prius omnes meas cogitationes certa genus distribuam quibusnam ex illis veritas aut falsitas proprie consistat inquiram quaedam ex tanquam rerum imago sunt quibus solis proprie convenit ideae nomen ut cum hominem vel chimaeram vel coelum vel angelum vel deum cogito aliae vero alias quasdam praeterea formas habent ut cum volo cum timeo cum affirmo cum nego semper quidem aliquam rem ut subjectum meae cogitationis apprehendo sed aliquid etiam amplius quam istius rei similitudinem cogitatione complector ex aliae voluntates sive affectus alia autem iudicia appellantur iam quod ad idea attinet si solae se spectentur nec ad aliud quid illas referam falsae proprie esse non possunt nam sive capram sive chimaeram imaginor non minus verum est unam imaginari quam alteram atque paulo inferius isthaec quae omnia satis demonstrant non hactenus ex certo judicio sed tantum ex caeco aliquo impulsu credidisse re quasdam diversas existere quae idea sive imago suas per organon sensuum vel quolibet alio pacto mihi immittant ecce pictorem imago quibus nec angelos ipsumque deum accensere dubitavit nonne enim teipsum appello tripartitam ille intellectualium operationum divisionem instituit nonne primo divisione membro idea illas tanquam rerum imago attribuit nonne ipsum imaginationis opisicium primasque simplicesque rerum repraesentationes judicium praecedentes easdem esse decrevit nunc vero pictorem factum tandem philosophum audiamus ego passim ubique ac praecipue hoc loco ostendo nomen ideae sumere pro omni eo quod immediate mente percipitur adeo ut cum volo timeo quia simul percipio velle timere ipsa volitio timor inter idea numerentur ususque sum hoc nomine quia jam tritum erat philosophis ad formas perceptionum mentis divinae significandas quamvis nullam deo phantasiam agnoscamus quaecun que nunc denuo nostrae apprehensiones simul idea evaserunt hac ipsa etiam de causa quod nullus phantasiae locus esse debeat ad quam ut ideae proprie pertinerent ab eximio philosopho dum pictor esse voluit sancitum est cum itaque haec omnia tam confuse obscure philosophus siquid philosophi defensor apertius enodatius ellcuerit videamus habes cartesi ne tantae tuae felicitati non gratularer eruditissimum ac perspicacissimum apologistam qui diligentia summa omnia magistri sui defendat quomodo autem hac defensu u quomodo tanta sua solertia illustraturus est per ideam ait id omne intelligitur quod alicujus perceptionis est forma adeo ut idea aliud non sit quam mentis conceptus sive re mente concepta intellecta alibi vero idem ad hanc rationem quandoquidem idea sit id ipsum quod ratione evincitur ut alia quae quolibet modo percipiantur eodem itaque denuo relabimur altera siquidem definitio quae quo formaretur idea non solum ut re perciperetur verum etiam ut intelligeretur requirit quanquam nonnihil ab illa magistri dissideat qua imaginatio jus idearum obtinuerat clarior tamen sibi convenientior erat donec altera tandem superveniens subito supplantavit quippe nunc idea non amplius tantum esse persistit quicquid ratio evincat sed quaecuque praeterea volueris quae quolibet modo percipiantur spatiosum sane exercendi campum primum quippe idea fuisse perhibetur tanquam rerum imago deinde fit re quaelibet quam ratione intuearis cognoscas denique re quaevis quocunque modo istam percipias nullane itaque de causa theologum interrogasse magistrum putas nosti quid sit idea quas latini rerum formas graeci nonlatin alphabet vocant vel si putas vobis propulsare potestis quod ille mox objectavit et tamen quid sit idea saepius lacessitus aut quae quales suae cartesii sunt nunquam quavis descriptione explicare vellet quid enim faceret theologus num secundum priscam vocis significationem secundum novam aliquam vestram intelligeret atqui secundum priscam vocis significationem intelligere certe non potuit ni artesianam platonicam de ideis opinionem unam esse cognosset quam nec esse abunde liquet siquidem platonicae sola mentis attentione vestrae mentis attentione quolibet alio modo percipiantur quinetiam plato ut existunt divina intelligentia contemplatus est vos autem ut vobis rebus immittuntur quarum sunt ideae quanto igitur illo quam hoc nomine puriores sunt tanto quidem quantumvis sensibus abhorreas praejudiciorum quamvis tyrannidem plane extinxeris ideae platonicae vestris justiores erunt ac simpliciores theologo igitur juxta genuinum vocabuli sensum interpretari ne licuit qui vero re secus interpretabuntur quam alii solent interpretari pro ii ut ipse submonuisti nunquam possumus satis neque vero ille propterea disquisitionem istam intermitteret nam quem novum sensum veteri termino magister imponeret apertissima ratione definiturum expectarat quocirca cum tantum definitionum allegoricarum ac incertarum cumulum offenderit e quibus aliae aliis latiores nec duae quaevis eadem vi normaque essent aegriuseule tulisse quid mirum nosti ergo inquit quid sit idea quoniam saepius iacessitus quid sit idea nunquam dicere aut quae quales tuae sunt nunquam quavis descriptione explicare velles qui tu respondes explicaret revera ideae nomen adeo simplex est omnibusque ita evidens ut per alias vox magi perspicuas vix explicari posse videatur qui ver insignissime evenit ut postquam jam tres quatuorve vestras definitiones medium eduximus idea tandem adeo simplex conceptus sit ut definiri non ferat quae re ne tibi cederet opprobrium aliqualem saltem hanc definitionem exarasti ideae sunt formae uniuscujusque nostrarum cogitationum cujus immediata perceptione earundem cogitationum cognitionem habemus ergo nonne idea plusquam nota recognitionis esse videtur quippe quod idearum munus sit naturam genusque rerum quarum sunt ideae exhibere ad unum omnes consentiunt quin tu nudam tuarum cogitationum identitatis notationem distinctam rerum de quibus cogitas naturae affectionum delineationem esse contendes recognitio illa sane indicio sit conceptus nostros esse tale quales sunt non vero esse idea rerum quarum esse concipiuntur quid enim si contemplando animae ideam ideam istam id esse quod de illius essentia concepisti tecum recognoscas ni tamen vera sit animae idea archetypon suum male exhibebit ideoque idea esse nequibit cujus naturam magister statuit quod sit imago rei atqui nihilominus apologistam male habent ista theologi cum philosopho expostulantis tu igitur qua forma quave specie sit immensa numinis majestas intelligis si intelligere te ai cur figura quadam non descripseris aut fando explicaveris enimvero quis deum tu reponis sub aliqua figura aut sibi aut aliis unquam repraesentare potest atque profecto te opinari quod ita repraesentari non possit mihi omnino arridet quodsi magister non minus aperte sententiam suam exposuerat theologo istam ulterius inquirere nihil opus esset cum vero idea suas tanquam imago rerum descripserit cum inter tanquam imago rerum homines chimaerae coeli angeli etiam numinis imaginem reposuerit no quaeso qua praerogativa excipiemus qua de communi picturarum apparatu tollemus postea contra quendam objectorem profitetur renatus se per ideam dei nihil intelligere nisi quam divinorum attributorum notitiam inter contemplandum assequamur ergo quantum cujusmodi sit istanotitia sequentibus ostendemus interea quaeramus quo obsecro consilio tam vehementer theologum id cartesio castigantem quod tu theologo redarguis cui quemadmodum cartesium omnium idearum dignitatem exaequare sic tibi theologum puram intellectionem ab imaginatione non distinxisse minime complacuit si vero eundem quem tuus cartesius errorem devenerit theologus vel te neutrum horum vel non hunc magi quam illum corripere omnino decebat en vero cujusmodi specimen quo differentiam idearum intellectus imaginationis aperires ipse adduxisti dum triangulum imaginor non tantum intelligo illam esse figuram tribus lineis comprehensam sed simul etiam istas tres lineas tanquam praesentes mentis acie intueor illud est quod proprie imaginari appellamus si vero de chiliogono cogitare velim equidem bene intelligo illud figuram esse mille lateribus constantem ac intelligo triangulum esse figuram constantem tribus sed non eodem modo illa mille latera imaginor sive tanquam praesentia contemplor quasi aliquis quin intellectus imaginationis ideae longe inter se discrepent quin illae quam hae multo magi sint perspicuae dubitaret quid autem est quod imaginationem tam parvi ducas quasi minus isto actu eliciendo quam alio quocunque men versaretur quippe cum mihi inquis siguram trianguli proponam non modo intelligo triangulum esse figuram tribus lineis comprehensam sed tres lineas tanquam praesentes intueor quod si rem sic habere tueberis vel actus intellectionis intuitionis unum confundes cum tamen idem distinctos esse subinnuas vel si sunt plures necesse est hic post illum exeratur quemadmodum etiam chiliogonum seu myriogonum apprehendi poterit eo duntaxat apprehensionis discrimine quod alterum per imaginationem citius atque facilius quam alterum effingamus cum tres trianguli lineae primo intuitu anguli autem myriogoni gradatim perlustrentur quod si corpus animo conciperes conceptique superficiei partem unam post aliam ita distribueres ut mille angulos prae se ferret integram tunc ipsius myriogoni picturam per imaginationem tibi exhibuisti quid vero demum absurdi foret siquidem actum quo apprehendamus triangulum esse figuram tribus lineis contentam actum quo quasi tribus lineis constitutam intueamur unum esse judicaremus quam primum enim triangulum talem figuram esse apprehendamus nobismet ut talem imaginationis opera repraesentemus sed de hac plus satis ad summam j definitionem deveniamus quae ni falleris ideae tantae tuae quantum sit summi ipsius numinis miraculum liquido evincat dei nomine intelligo substantiam quandam infinitam independentem summe intelligentem summe potentem qua tum ego ipse tum aliud omne si quid aliud extat quodcun que extat est creatum atque sane omnia ista recte intelligis attamen no e deludimur cum enim effulgentissima tam immensae ideae repraesentatione beares quid hoc nisi deum ut vere est rem non definiendam definire cujus propterea si vobis fidem habebimus ideam adipisci nequimus nec certe est quod de terminis negativis conqueratis siquidem amplissima nostra positiva conceptio ad rem ipsam minime quadret animae si placet jam cunctas simul sacultates exercebo intellectum vehementissino nisu delassabo voluntatem sensusque penitus submittam infinitum aliquod amplexu meo suscipere prorsus negatur myriogoni quidem specie mihi tanquam ipsius repugnantiae idea suit diuturna tamen attentaque dispectione verum accuratum de illo conceptum elaboravi cum autem demens easdem rationes inirem quo cujusdam infiniti notionem nanciscerer nullum plane initium nullam reperiendi spem reperire possum quinetiam reperiendi studio meipsum fere tandem derelinquo nae certo certius esse cognovi quod infinitum quoddam existit cum vero tantam naturam describere mihi sumam ignorantiam ipse meam propatulo deridendam eloco cum infinitam independentem esse definio non esse concipiendam non comprehendendam agnosco annon igitur theologus istud quandam summo jure reprehendit quid enim hoc est quam quae fuerit ista substantia te omninio nescire nisi obscurus esse vellet cartesius omittere non licuit cur quaeso non licuit quid enim deum esse substantiam quandam respectu generis vel numerice voluit atqui istud tantam quidem viri imprudentiam argueret ut nobismet nullo pacto suspicari permittamus cum tamen adeo supervacaneum foret si numeri notam esse designavit ut magistrum illum definitorum coryphaeum hanc definitionem ingessisse videns etiam oculis vix mihi persuadeam enimvero si unitas necessario infinitate seu infinita excellentia includatur adeo ut infinitum id quod tu definire audes non nisi unum esse possit quid signis pluribus individualitatis opus est suffecerant isthaec dei nomine intelligo substantiam infinitam independentem c ergo tu videsis quo demum absolutissima quam jactaras idea
