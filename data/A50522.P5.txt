peccat confusione temporum nam licet praelium michaelis incidat tempus templi mensurabilis templum tamen non prius citius mensurandum fuisse quam commissum fuit praelium draconis nescio quo argumento confirmari possit non enim quia proxime antecedentia sunt contemporaneorum idcirco est necesse utriusque originem aeque altum deducendam esse equidem fateor apocalypsin nihil habere antiquius quodve altius originem ducat muliere puerpera cujus partui insidiatus est draco attamen ipse partus quem excipit praelium draconis multo est recentior cum partus sit novissimi temporis finali iudaeorum conversione ut postea demonstrabitur quemadmodum etiam est recentior templi commensuratio quae incidit novissima tempora tuba sextae quae exordium velle ducere prophetiae repetitae quae nempe tempora apocalyptica ab origine quasi ab ovo relegat est cum ratione velle insanire ut mox pluribus ostendetur septimus synchronismus qui ultimus partis primae septem phialarum bestiae babylonisque ad occasum vergentium est verissimus certissimus ac proinde progredior ad synchronismos partis secundae initio sumpto ab examine praeloquii quod illi praemittitur stricturae partem secundam praeloquio partis secundae inepta est illa totius apocalypsews du partes principales partitio quarum prior sit sigillorum iisque tubabarum posterior nonlatin alphabet seu libri aperti versu octavo capitis decimi usque ad finem libri quae omnium errorum mihi videtur esse praecipuum fundamentum ineptam eam voco reprobandam puto ob sequentes rationes primo quia confundit finem unius prophetiae cum principio alterius finis prophetiae sigillorum est turba illa palmifera gaudentium utpote quae ipso synchronista teste incidat tubam novissimam ne vero vel tantillum dubitaremus turba illa gaudentium esse sinem sigillorum statim post eam fit mentio silentii coelo facti quasi medium hora qua projecto nihil aliud significatur quam ioannem visionibus praecedentis prophetiae ad medium horae quievisse ac proinde eam absolutam esse ergo hic finis unius prophetiae principium alterius est tuba prima quae clangere coepit statim post ignem e coelo terram missum apoc qui certe nullus est alius quam de quo ipse christus dixerat luc ignem veni mittere terram quid volo nisi ut ardeat ne vero hic etiam haesitaremus tuba prima initium esse nova prophetiae praemittitur ei visio praeparatoria post factum coelo silentium hic itaque principium alterius prophetiae quae tamen cum fine praecedentis hac partitione confunditur secundo quia discerpit membra unius ejusdemque prophetiae arctissime cohaerentia nemo enim dubitat tubis recto ordine continuari unam eandemque prophetiam sic ut ibi desinat quinta ubi incipit sexta sexta ibi desinat ubi incipit septima haec partitio finem sextae tuba divellit ab ipsius principio sic divellit ut ex fine tuba sextae constituat novam prophetiam quae altius assurgat quam tuba prima imo originem suam trahat sigillo primo principium enim sextae tuba suit fine capitis noni illius finis incidit principium capitis undecimi quod tamen ut dixi fingitur esse initium nova prophetiae quae inchoatur prima temporis apocalyptici periodo tertio quia commiscet duas ad minimum integras prophetias toto coelo se invicem distinctas nam certum est prophetiam libri aperti terminari cum fine tuba septimae quae est novissima nec minus certum est prophetiam de muliere parturiente esse novam prophetiam ut qua muliere nihil prius antiquius habeat apocalypsis quemadmodum fatetur ipse synchronista quomodo ergo haec eadem est cum prophetia libri aperti fuerunt qui sibi persuaderent tuba prodire ex sinu sigilli septimi sed quando perveniunt ad caput duodecimum coguntur agnoscere initium nova prophetiae invenias ergo aliquos qui totam apocalypsin dividunt duas partes principales sed qui posteriorem partem inchoat principio capitis undecimi invenias neminem profecto mulier parturiens cap est synagoga iudaica quae patrem habet iacobum qui assimilatur solo matrem rachaelem quae comparatur lunae descendit duodecim patriarchis qui simile esse dicuntur duodecim stellis gravida illa fuit ab ipsis diebus ioannis clamavit parturiens cruciabatur ut pareret postquam templum eorum urbs funditus romani fuere eversa quemadmodum id ipsa synagoga confitetur sub hac eadem allegoria esa sicut quae concepit cum appropinquaverit ad partum dolens clamat doloribus suis sic facti sumus facie tua domine nondum tamen ipsa peperit sed inopinatus aderit illius partus finali iudaeorum conversione cujus mentio fit apud eundem prophetam e antequam parturiret peperit antequam veniret partus ejus peperit masculinumquia parturivit peperit sion filios suos esse enim hunc partum ultimi temporis apparet ex ioanne qui hunc partum immediate docet praecedere fugam mulieris desertum quae incidit novissima tempora tuba sextae apoc cum apoc collatis hinc micheas de eodem partu verba faciens eundem expresse refert ad tempora novissima cap propter hoc dabit eos viz iudaeos manibus hostium suorum usque ad tempus quo parturiens pariet reliquiae fratrum ejus revertentur ad filios israel sic enim judico superiores prophetas interpretandos esse ex collatione eorundem cum apocalypsi quae clavis est omnis scripturae propheticae atque hinc apparet dictam prophetiam de muliere parturiente provehi ad caput originem periodi apocalypticae ac proinde ea inchoari novam prophetiam redeo ad rem ipsam praemissa hac partitione affirmat synchronista posteriorem apocalypsews partem quae est nonlatin alphabet seu libri aperti ab eodem temporis apocalyptici principio exordiri unde prior illa quae est sigillorum illius tempora relegere versu octavo capitis decimi usque ad finem verum ista omnia pro libitu conficta prorsus absurda sunt septem sigilla fuerunt aperta clanxerunt quinque tuba sexta clangorem inchoavit descenditur ad illius finem quem proxime excipit septima fine tuba sextae inchoabitur nova prophetia quae originem ducat ab ipso sigillo primo quis credet istis nisi cui libitum est posteriora prioribus summa imis miscere et quomodo superiora tempora releguntur versu octavo capitis decimi cum ab illo versu usque ad finem illius capitis nulla omnino tempora legantur quae vero tempora sequuntur principio capitis undecimi aut tempora sunt finis tuba sextae aut tempora illius nulla sunt attamen recaepitulationem illam temporum putat synchronista indicari transicione ista v cap oportet te iterum nonlatin alphabet prophetare sed longe aliud est iterum prophetare aliud iterum prophetare eadem aut ab eodem exorsa temporis principio haec duo multum differunt ego hoc dictum fuisse existimo ioanni typum rei hoc tempore eventurae quod nempe ecclesia nunc ante exitum tuba sextae sit reformanda de novo prophetatura tum contra tum apud populos multos qua mihi assentientem habeo doctissimum paraeum ioannes inquit non tam sua quam omnium praeconum veritatis qui sub finem tuba sextae futuri erant persona librum devorare iterumque propherare jubetur et est sensus oportere ut ubi antichristus satis saevierit prophetia adversus eum restituatur tandem relabitur synchronista ad bimembrem suam partitionem ed que confirmari opinatur ex eo quod hic idem sit prophetiae initium quod fuit prophetiae de septem ecclesiis item de septem sigillis quas nemo dubitat esse nova prophetias sunt autem haec initia visionis quidem de septem ecclesiis cap audivi vocem magnam tergo tanquam tuba dicentis prophetia autem sigillorum cap et vox prima quam audivi tanquam tuba loquentis mecum denique prophetiae nonlatin alphabet cap et vox quam audieram e coelo scilicet tanquam tuba loquentis rurium loquebatur mecum verum haec posterior vox non eadem est cum prima illa cum hoc nomine non indigitetur nec dicitur audita fuisse instar tuba loquentis sed vox fuit proxime e coelo audita vers ejusdem capitis audivi vocem de coelo dicentem mihi signa quae locuta sunt septem ronitrua ne scribas ea eadem ergo vox quae v vetuerat scribere nunc v jubet devorare libellum prophetare ut bene monet paraeus nolo tamen hac de acrius cum quoquam contendere dato itaque eandem esse vocem cum illa priore non tamen inde sequetur quia alias alibi inchoavit novam prophetiam ideo id quoque hoc loco fecisse certiora sunt indicia nova prophetiae ut quod singulae aut inchoentur nova visione aut terminentur mentione secundi adventus quae indicia sunt rerum non aucupia verborum visio ecclesiarum terminatur mentione novissimae c nae apoc quae coena est secundi adventus apoc visio sigillorum terminatur mentione turbae palmiferae gaudentium quae incidit novissimam tubam visionis tubarum quam paulus esse docet tubam secundi adventus cor visio mulieris terminatur mentione messis apoc quam ipse christus interpretatur consummationem seculi matt visio phialarum terminatur interitu babylonis apoc quae incidit secundum adventum apoc eodem termino clauditur visio meretricis apoc visio denique christi vincentis clauditur mentione universalis resurrectionis duplicis nova hierosolymae septem itaque erant visiones tanquam totidem totius apocalypsews partes principales sed haec sufficiant ad praeloquium veni ad ipsos synchronismos partis secundae synchronismum primum appellat cardinem synchronismorum ego vero eundem voco cardinem vanitatum adeo nihil est eo veri nihil certi synchronismum esse vult sigilli septimi quoad sex priores tuba cum bestia septicipite bicorni caeterisque contemporantibus sed jam antea demonstravi sex tuba non pertinere ad sigillum septimum demonstravi insuper bestiam bicornem bestiae septicipili caeteris non omnibus nec ad amussim contemporare nunc demonstrabo initium bestiae septicipitis non contemporare cum initio sigilli septimi quod praecipuum est hujus synchronismi fundamentum eversum ire bestia septiceps est ipsissimum regnum antichristi sub novissimo e septimo suo capite atqui antichristus demum lucem producitur sub tuba sexta apoc vel quod ego malim sub tuba quinta apoc ubi angelum abyssi eundem esse puto cum bestia ascensura ex abysso apoc et proculdubio est antichristus cum vocetur nomine antichristi graeca ecclesiae recepto nonlatin alphabet vel nonlatin alphabet thessal hebraice autem nomen habet abadu servus ille nonlatin alphabet sic dictus ie servus servorum sic enim hebraeus syrus legunt quod si quis malit legere cum correctioribus exemplaribus graecis abbadon hoc idem significat quod papadominus quam lectionem etiam retinuit vulgatus latinus rectius itaque bestia septiceps contemporabit cum tuba quinta sigillune quintum tempus est persecutionis sanctorum ut certum est ex illis verbis donec compleantur conservi eorumqui intersiciendi sunt sicut illi apoc atqui hoc proprium munus est bestiae ipsa itaque rectius dicetur contemporare cum sigillo quinto initium septimi sigilli est obsignatione coetus illius virginalis cap ipso synchronista confitente atqui obsignatio illa sequitur illustrem domini adventum qui describitur sigillo sexto quem incidit bestiae interitus ut apparet ex collatione apoc cum apoc impossibile itaque est bestiam septicipitem contemporare cum initio sigilli septimi inquit ille coetus illius obsignationem supra ostendi contemporare ad amussim cum bestia septicipite parte prima synchronismo quarto respondeo contrarium liquet ex nostra ad eundem censura quod porro existimet obsignationem illam factam esse ne grassantibus orbe tubarum calamitatibus electi dei servi extinguerentur gratis fingitur sine ullo fundamento obsignationem illam dico sactam esse ad nova nuptias agni illustri domini adventu celebrandos ut manifestum ex hujusce locus collatione cum esdrae videte numerum signatorum convivio domini ad quem hic certus est respectus scio librum istum esse apocryhum sed potest liber apocryphus interdum continere quasdam antiquas veras narrationes denique falsum est obsignatione illa turbari non interrumpendam sigillorum seriem ipse enim synchronista fatetur illam pertinere ad finem sigilli sexti sive ad initium septimi merito quia expresse dicitur apoc nonlatin alphabet id est post haec nempe quae acciderunt sigillo sexto ego judico obsignationem virginum turbam palmiferam gaudentium esse totum mysterium sigilli septimi quod demum narratur apertum fuisse initio cap cum capite septimo praemissum sit illius mysterium quemadmodum primum vae demum narratur praeteriisse post praemissam illius calamitatem apoc sic ergo corruit omnium sequentium synchronismorum fundamentum eorum nempe qui ex primo isto deducuntur quos tamen etiam examinabo ne quis queratur aliquid praeteritum esse aut neglectum synchronismum secundum ait esse contemporantium atrii interioris praelii draconis michaelis de puerperio cum sex primis sigillis atqui dimensuratio templi sic enim loqui malim quia textus expresse illius meminit tempore prior est praelio draconis ut visum supra synchronismo sexto parte prima neulrum contemporat cum sex primis sigillis non dimensuratio templi quia jubetur ioannes templum metiri sub finem tuba sextae apoc iam vero finem tuba sextae contemporare cum sigillo primo quis dixerit non praelium draconis quia illud commissum absolutum fuit brevissimo temporis spatio puta momento ictu oculus nam statim fuit commissum post raptum partum absolutum fuit ante fugam mulieris desertum apoc mulier statim immediate post raptum partum fugere debuit desertum apoc ita que tantummodo momento perduravit quomodo ergo potuit contemporare cum sex primis sigillis accedo ad synchronismum tertium phialarum cum tuba sexta dicendum erat ni fallor cum initio tuba septimae nam tuba septima est tuba novissima septem autem phialae continent novissimas calamitates apoc pertinent ergo ad tubam novissimam tuba etiam septima est tuba consummationis quia sub ea consummabitur mysterium dei apoc septem autem phialae sunt plagae consummationis utpote quibus consummetur ira dei apoc pertinent ergo ad tubam septimam sed haec parum ad rem regnum vero bestiae sub sexta tuba

sequitur statim par est ejus quod praecessit cur non igitur septem tonitruum vox etiam par essent tuba sextae quod tamen negat quod propius illius tuba clangorem excepit eo non pertinebit pertinebit

eandem facere dicit cum prophetia libri aperti ego vero ut jam ante monui prophetiam libri aperti voco non unicam aliquam visionem sed totum illud visionum syntagma quas ioannes vidit postquam ei

errore manifestario traducit adeone cum duo affirment idem non est idem aut valde fallor aut hic vir doctus prae nimio stringendi calore sui oblitus est inquit certum est prophetiam libri aperti terminari cum fine tuba septimae prophetiam vero de muliere parturiente quae hanc sequitur prophetiam plane novam esse qua nihil antiquius habet apocalypsis quomodo igitur haec par erit libri aperti hoc scil argumento suam meamque sententiam labefactatum sed respondeo pro meipso pro theocrito iusto omnino facillime prophetia enim libri aperti non est una aliqua prophetia continuum sed multarum ut dixi visionum partim continuantium partim contemporantium systema quarum una sola id est pri totum intervallum apocalypticum pervadit reliquae huic tanquam partes contemporantes annectuntur ita visio de muliere parturiente par est prophetiae libri aperti non continuum sed primae visioni quae communem illam tuba novissimae catastrophen desinit contemporanea parallela quae porro subjungit de interpretatione visionis de puerperio mulierem parturientem esse synagogam iudaicam quae patrem habuit iacobum qui assimilatur solo matrem rachaelem quae comparatur lunae c ut nimirum demonstret visionem istam provehi ad caput originem periodi apocalypticae ac proinde ea novam prophetiam inchoari haec inquam similia sicco pede pertranseo cum ut saepe jam monui nullus sit hoc examine id genus

ad septimi sigilli apertionem exhibitam ad primo sigilli initium retraxit sigillorum tramitem relegere fecit mihi tamen pro immani crimine impingit quod post finitam sextae tuba descriptionem nam uniuscujusque tuba ut dixi visum tantum unicum est postque septimae tuba praeconium diserte exhibitum de consummatione mysterii dei tum futura postquam etiam septem tonitrua vox suas edidissent quas ipse ad septimam tubam pertinere affirmat voluerim tamen ex sequentibus nova prophetiae initium facere cum illud non modo ex synchronismorum meorum syntaxi necessario secuturum advertissem verum eodem etiam praeter opinionem facere viderem verba illa longe disertissima oportet te iterum prophetare populis gentibus linguis regibus multis ille sibi silentium semihorae sine ratione aut exemplo interpretanti credi postulat quod sit nova repetitae prophetiae indicium mihi spiritui sancto id disertis perspicuis verbis affirmanti credere non licet sed plus ego lawene hujusmodi verborum aucupiis sic enim vocas fido quam cujusvis hominum interpretamentis nisi ea quoque verba perspicue consentientia habuerint ut omnino frustra si qui mihi hic pro verbis clarissimis nonlatin alphabet interpretationem maxime dubiam incertam alius violentam dixerit obtruseris ad objectum de currente adhuc nec dum absoluta sextae tuba descriptione respondeo finem tuba sextae esse ad finem capitis noni nec ultra protendi visionem ejus nam unicum esse cuique tuba visum sicut sigillis phialis non duo vel plura deinde primam partem capitis decimi ad septimam tubam pertinere quod ipse quod ad septem tonitrua non diffitetur angeli verba manifesta sunt quod reliquum est hujus capitis cum capite sequente ad novam prophetiam pertinere monente id ipsum spiritu sancto ita prophetiam sigillorum tubarum proprie reapse claudi magno illo angeli tonitruum de tempore ad clangorem tuba septimae finiendo mysterio dei consummando praeconio sed quoniam mysterium illud communis foret tum hujus tum alterius prophetiae catastrophe tum maxime ut sciretur qua demum ratione sequens prophetia cum hac tubarum connectenda esset ideo clangoris ipsiusmet de praesenti exhibitionem evolutionem pleniorem ab angelo eousque suspensam donec altera prophetia prima sua visione ad idem temporis apocalyptici momentum provecta tanquam lime synchronisticus communis utriusque prophetiae exitus inter ereretur dicam si possim planius quoniam video domino laweno non intelligi utraque prophetia tam sigillorum quam nonlatin alphabet uno eodemque rerum exitu clauditur quem exhibet tuba novissima cui indicando spiritus sanctus tuba septimae mysterio suo loco tubarum serie quantum tunc satis erat designato clangorem ipsum distulit donec ad novam nonlatin alphabet prophetiam transitione facta primam ipsius visionem stadio apocalyptico similiter emenso ad eundem rerum exitum provexisset tuncque mysterium illud tuba septimae utriusque prophetiae clausula communis priori prophetia de genere tantum promulgatum hic clangore edito plenius evolvitur idque commodissime cum alioquin absque utriusque prophetiae praecognitione quod ab utraque pendebat intelligi non potuisset et profecto ni haec spiritus sancti men fuisset nec juramentum de septimae tuba clangore mysterio eo locus inseruisset nec verba statim ioanni de prophetia repetenda fecisset quorsum enim haec nisi ut duplici isto indicio certos no faceret de fine prophetiae tubarum illic indubie statuendo non obstante quod postmodum de clangore tuba septimae nova isti prophetiae interserendum esset ego tamen ut quod initio dixi iterum repetam nihilominus hujusmodi discursibus bimembrem meam partitionem non superstruxi neque praeloquio meo tanquam fundamentum proposui sed solummodo monui eam consectarium fore synchronismorum mox demonstrandorum eique apprime convenire angeli verba visionem cap exhibitam nisi igitur quos demonstravi synchronismos istiusmodi partitionem conficiant causam non dico quin prorsus eliminetur postremum addidi illud lectoris animadversione non indignum fore ad utriusque istarum perinde atque primae omnium visionis de septem ecclesiis quasi trium integrarum prophetiarum initia singula voce tanquam tuba de coelo loquentis proclamari c hic mihi opponit lawenus multo certiora nova prophetiae indicia ut quod singulae aut inchoentur nova visione aut terminentur mentione secundi adventus sed annon quae ego attuli sunt novarum visionum initia aut dicat quo tandem signo internoscatur nova visionis exordium praesertim si illud nonlatin alphabet pro hujusmodi signo non habendum sit sed vult ni fallor eam visionem pro nova habendam esse quam proxime praecessit mentio secundi adventus neque hujus notae tribunal partitio mea recusabit quid enim annon angeli septem tonitruum praeconium de consummatione mysterii dei quod libri comestionem praecessit ad secundum adventum pertingit sed quorsum haec omnia non enim hic de nova visionis aut prophetiae cujuslibet initio quaeritur sed de initio prophetiae repetitae num ubicunque mentio secundi adventus praecessit ibi initium est prophetiae repetitae id est quae eundem tramitem propheticum capite remeat non credo de ejusmodi initio inter no agitur interim ut non diffiteor secundum adventum si dextre accipiatur esse certissimum indicium prophetiae consummantis eoque visionem quae sequitur ejusmodi esse quae priori continuari non possit ita nego hunc adventum pro unico visionis nova secuturae indicio habendum esse nego item cujusvis interpretamentum pro secundi adventus argumento admittendum mihi quidem persuasissimum est sigillum sextum non esse de secundo adventu novit dominus lawenus non paucos su sragatores habere eorum numero esse andream caesariensem nihil tamen ei superstruo quia interpretamentum est ideaque negari possit nisi aliunde firmetur et messem illam c v esse secundum christi adventum quo argumento negantem convinceret nam alia quoque est salvatoris messis praeter consummationem seculi messis inquit multa operarii vero pa ci imo si messis c sit consummatio seculi quid tandem erit vindemia quae messem sequitur eadem quoque de coena dici possunt c nec ignorat dominus lawenus haec ab aliis aliter interpretata esse unicum illud de vniversali resurrectione iudicio c clarum disertum est ideoque indubium videt igitur dominus lawenus quam hujusmodi argumenta imbellia sint interim ego non nego septem esse apocalypsi visiones insigniores forte etiam plures neque hoc bimembrem meam divisionem quatit ut quae alio spectavit neque visiones distinxit sed syntagma visionum ad censuram synchronismi sigilli septimi quod ad priores sex tuba cum bestia septicipite bicorni caeterisque contemporantibus hujus demonstratione lawenus totus interpretationum praejudiciis occaecatus nihil omnino veri cernere potuit adjuvabo igitur si possum admoto lumine summa demonstrationis haec fuit qua de initio qua de fine de initio sic cum coetus obsignatorum tanquam bestiae regnantis nonlatin alphabet bestiae contemporet idemque coetus obsignatorum contemporet initio sigilli septimi seu tubarum sequitur bestiam quoque contemporare initio sigilli septimi seu tubarum de fine autem sic cum testium sacco lugentium dy finiantur ad exitum tuba seu ineunte septima ibidem quoque bestiae menses finiri necesse est per consequens illam bestiae tyrannidem intra sex primarum tubarum ambitum contineri fatetur lawenus coetum obsignatorum contemporare sigillo septimo vult enim obsignationem illam esse totum sigilli istius mysterium quod quidem nimium est sed inde sumo quantum mihi satis est nempe coetum illum sigillum sextum proxime sequi atque ita inire cum septimo hoc autem posito nulla ei amplius elabendi copia superest nisi aut negando septem tuba rem esse

inquit istorum regum suscitabit deus coeli regnum quod secula non destructur hoc est temporibus reipublicae istius multiregiae suscitabitur regnum christi ecula duraturum sciendum igitur est statum romanum capitibus utcunque varium admodum corpore tamen unum fuisse atque ut daniel propter multiformem capitum varietatem quartam hanc bestiam nulli terris bestiae assimilare potuitcap ita neque unitas regni romani ex capitibus aestimari potest aut debet sed ex unitate populi regnantis super orbem terratum civitas enim una eademque sub tam multiformi majestate regnabat super reges terrae ut ioannesapoc loquitur unde caput orbis vrbs orbis domina audiebat atque ex istis facile cernere est quam male obtinuit usus ut quatuor ista danielis regna quatuor monarchiae nuncuparentur ut enim de romano taceam de quo nunc li est certum est graecorum regnum de quo nemo dubitat quin danielis regnis accenseri debeat post alexandrum amplius monarchiam non fuisse sed plures reges dispertitum dixi satis quid regnum mihi sit quid romanum sequitur jam ut danielis regna quid sint curque ita nominentur breviter ostendam danielis igitur regna dico quatuor ista regna seu regnorum seriem quam primo ex nebuchadnezaris babylonii somnio de statua quadruplicis materiae daniel divinitus edoctus exposuit dan cap de iisdemque postea daniel ipse quatuor bestiarum sibi oblata visione plenius ab angelo eruditus est dan cap est autem quaternio iste regnorum danielis quod imprimis observari velim chronologia quaedam prophetica non tam annorum quam regnorum intervallis distincta ubi regnorum praecipua orbis terrarum parte simul ecclesiam populum dei complexa sibi invicem succedentium serie monstratur tempus quo christi regnum tot seculis promissum primum nonlatin alphabet inchoandum sit idemque demum certis temporibus consummandum et primum quidem vaticinium quod imaginis est sive statuae utrumque regni christi momentum designat tam inchoandi quam olim consummandi alterum vero quod quatuor bestiarum viso adumbratur ad alterum tantum illius momentum intendit quando omnibus hostibus devictis universa mundi regna christi imperio legibus subjicientur oportet enim eum regnare teste apostolo usque quo omnes inimicos supposuerit pedibus suis cor hujus autem prophetiarum harum meta intuenda discriminis ea ratio est quod utrumque illud regni christi momentum non consummandi tantummodo sed etiam inchoandi hujus quidem ad solas gens pertinebat id quod rejectione obduratione iudaeorum inde ab initio christianismi huc usque satis ab eventu comprobatum est hinc igitur quae nebuchadnezari homini scilicet gentili visio oblata est ea utrumque designabat regni christi momentum vero ad iudaeos alterum duntaxat momentum quo consummandum est regnum christianum pertinebat nam hierosolyma calcabitur gentibus donec impleantur tempora gentium luc vers occupavit eos ira nonlatin alphabet thess cap vers quando vero plenitudo gentium introierit tunc totus israel salvabitur ad rom c v idcirco quae danieli ipsi homini iudaeo visio ostensa illud tantum regni christi momentum quasi hujus rei mysterium spectare debuit iam ex quae dictum sunt ratio quoque elucet quare ex omnibus mundi regnis quatuor haec sola selegit spiritus sanctus quorum fata tam insigni ornaret prophetia nempe quia ex solis inter omnia mundi regna periodus temporum ejusmodi contexi potuit quae rectum serie ordina successione perduceret ad tempora momentum regni christi non vero quia nulla istis paria imperium forsan aliquibus majora per omnia secula orbis visurus esset nam neque saracenorum olim neque hodie turcarum neque tartarorum regna ditionis amplitudine persico aut graeco puto nec assyrio quicquam concedunt imo ni allor excedunt fatendum est nihilominus unumquodque ex quatuor istis regnis vel quod minimum est ita esse comparatum ut merito summis praecipuis orbis terrarum imperiis annumeranda sint ut quorum omnium potestas non unius populi ambitu sed plurimarum gentium nationum imperio terminaretur unde statua nebuchadnezari ostensa ampla excellenti splendore terribili forma describitur danieli bestiae quatuor magnae e mari ascendentes apparuere ita ad problematis intellectum expositis venio ad argumenta quibus firmissime assertum ire confido regnum romanum esse quartum regnum danielis et primum quidem sic habet argumentum quo rerum potiente christi regnum jam olim coeptum est illud est quartum regnum danielis regno romano rerum potiente christi regnum coepit ergo major ex daniele constat qui quarto regno statua nebuchadnezaris descripto subdit diebus autem regum istorum suscitabit deus coeli regnum quod secula non destruetur neque populo alieno relinquetur diebus regum istorum vel ad verbum diebus illorum regum illorum id est quarti regni temporibus quod ut dixi multiregium erat futurum vel si cui hoc minus placuerit temporibus regum istorum hoc est constante adhuc nondum absoluta aut peracta quatuor istorum regum seu regnorum serie alterutra interpretatio necessaria est utravis idem plane obtinebo christi regnum suscitatum iri aliquo ex quatuor istis regno nondum elapso sed adhuc rerum potiente illud vero cum tertium certum est non fuisse necessario quartum erit id quod adhuc evidentius ex somnio ipso confirmatur regnum enim christi daniele interprete est lapis iste excisus sine manibus id est sine ope humana qui imaginem percussurus erat ad pes ipsius ferreos luteos adeoque comminueret illos ut locus ii non est inventus amplius cap vers vero qui potuit lapis imaginem percutere ad pes nisi saltem pes isti mansissent adhuc cum lapis e monte exscindebatur minor quoque romani imperantibus non graecis aut persis coepisse regnum christi non minus est manifesta quid enim annon nascente christo tota terra censebatur ab augusto

prophetia de somnio nebuchadnezaris cap v vidisti inquit usquedum excisus est lapis sine manibus percussit imaginem super pes ipsius ferreos luteos ut comminueret eos ita abstulit ea ventus nullus locus inventus est eis lapis autem qui percusserat imaginem effectus est mon magnus adeo ut impleret totam terram hoc est ipso daniele interprete diebus regni quarti suscitabit deus coeli regnvm hic est lapis iste e monte excisus quod secula non destruetur quodque populo alteri non relinquetur ut prioribus scilicet regnis factum est sed comminuet consumet omnia ista regna ipsum autem stabit secula hoc est lapis regni christi jam pluribus seculis ex monte hujus mundi excisus tandem cum tempus deo decretum advenerit exterminatis abolitis penitus quae huc usque vigent imaginis hujus partibus novissimis seu postremis ipse qui hucusque lapis duntaxat fuerat quidem offensionis tunc evadet montem ingentem implebitque totum terrarum orbem altera vero prophetia qua quaternio iste regnorum quatuor bestiarum visione adumbratur hujus rei demonstrationem suppeditat plane invictam nam ibi de quartae bestiae seu regni quarti postrema dynastia quae sub cornu isto monstroso futura erat cui oculus erant o loquens grandia de hoc inquam cornu affirmatur quod bellum cum sanctis gesturum erat e sque praevaliturum usquedum veniret antiquus dierum judicium daretur sanctis excelsorum tempusque veniret quo regnum possiderent sancti id est ut statim subdit donec regnum dominatusque amplitudo regnorum sub toto coelo dabitur populo sanctorum excelsorum cujus regnum erit perpetuum omnia dominia ei servient auscultabunt dan potuitne quidquam apertius dici quo probetur ultimi regni dynastiam ultimam eousque permansuram donec haec omnia de regno sanctorum quodcunque illud sit compleantur iam de minore propositione quod scilicet romano regno semel exacto abolito consummabitur regnum christi ex n test facilis est probatio nam ab abolitione antichristi consummabitur regnum christi ita paulus thess et revelabitur sceleratus ille quem dominus absumet spiritu oris sui abolebit splendore adventus sui vel ut syrus interficiet eum revelatione adventus sui ita quoque ex apocalypsi constat ad septimae id est ultimae tuba clangorem permansurum antichristum qua semel clangente fiunt vox coelo magnae facta sunt regna mundi domini nostri christi ejus qui regnabit secula seculorum id quod angelus verbis paulo ante praedixerat clangente tuba septima comsummatum iri mysterium dei sicut annunciavit servis suis prophetis c v cum c v vero antichristus exoriturus erat ex imperio romano ejusque par futura paulus thess iam peragitur mysterium iniquitatis tantum qui nunc detinet detinebit usquedum e medio sublatus fuerit id est romae imperator tunc revelabitur sceleratus ille et ioannes apertissime apoc affirmat futurum antichristum unum ex septem capitibus septicipitis bestiae cui urbs illa magna insidebat quae ioannis scilicet aevo regnum habebat super reges terrae si jam vrbs illa rom sit bestia que ista romanum regnum quod apud omnes credo saltem veteres confesso est erit tunc antichristus utpote caput istius bestiae postremum par regni romani ergoque regnum romanum durabit ad consummationem regni christi quo praeter hoc nullum quod serie danielis successionem habere potest pertinget unquam id quod sole meridiano clarius est imo ut hoc tanquam superpondium adjiciam antichristus iste novi testamenti ipsissimum est cornu monstrosum danielis penis quod ut ille ultimam quartae suae bestiae dynastiam praedixit futuram ita quoque ioannes sub antichristo suo sive pseudopropheta ultimam regni romani scenam peragendam esse quodque de cornu suo prodigioso daniel gerebat bellum cum sanctis praevalebat ii cap vers idem ioannes de suo monstro datum est ei inquit bellum gerere cum sanctis eos vincere apoc daniel cornu suo attribuit osloquens grandia quod verba adversus excelsum loqueretur sanctos ejus contereret cap vers idipsum ioannes de suo perdito refert datum est ei o loquens magna blasphemias aperuit o suum ad blasphemandum adversus deum ut convitiis assiceret tabernaculum ejus eos qui coelo habitant cap i3 vers ex ungue leonem quod dici solet neque more tantum sed tempus tyrannidis ad amussim convenitvers quod enim daniel de cornu portentoso tradentur inquit sancti manum ejus usque ad tempus tempora dimidium temporis idipsum ioannis de sanato isto redivivo bestiae romanae capite data est inquit illi potestas agendi seu ut nonnulla exemplaria habent bellum gerendi menses quadraginta duo vers cap annon menses xlii sunt tres anni cum dimidio id est tempus tempora dimidium temporis ecce autem capite praecedente vers non rem tantum sed ipsa verba danielis mulier inquit id est ecclesia regnante antichristo fugit conspectu serpentis desertum ubi aleretur per tempus tempora dimidium temporis idem ergo prorsus est danielicae bestiae cornu prodigiosum cum antichristo ioannis apocalypsi et quoniam utrumque duraturum sit ad consummationem regni christi sequitur regnum romanum cujus par postrema est antichristus esse ipsissimum quartum regnum danielis cujusitidem par extremum est illa prodigiosi cornu dynastia frustra enim sunt qui cornu istud aliud bestia e cujus capite ena citur par est regnum esse volunt cornu enim potestates tantum bestiae vero regna distinguunt argumentum iii quod occupavit regnum tertium eidemque successit est quartum regnum danielis regnum romanum occupavit regnum tertium nempe graecorum eidemque successit ergo de majore nullus dubitandi locus quin illud quartum fuerit quod tertium proxime secutum est eidemque successerit de minore itidem patet ex historia quicquid ousque restabat de ditione regni graecorum id omne romani armis imperio cessisse praedixerat autem daniel regnum graecorum primo regis alexandri morte finibus suis diminutum iri neque ea ditionis amplitudine regnaturos successores ejus atque ipse ii reliquerat verba sunt cap vers effracto hirci cornu magno qui eodem interprete est primus rex graeciae quat cornu pro illo hoc est inquit quatuor regna ex ea gente assurrectura sunt fed non cum robore illius item cap v frangetur regnum ejus nempe regis potentis alexandri dividetur quatuor partes coeli sed non posteritati ejus neque secundum dominatum ejus quo dominatus fuerat et hoc innuere volebam eo quod dixi quicquid eousque restabat de dilione regni graecorum nequis forte quod non neminem fecisse scio requirat ut ad indos usque propagetur imperium romanum quartum regnum alioquin non futurum illa autem regni graecorum per romanos occupatio ineunda est morte antiochi epiphanis quando perseo ultimo rege macedonum ab aemilio consule devicto macedonia primarium regni graecanici caput provinciam redacta est atque ita cum reliqua sere graecia imperii romani iura concessit nec inde quieverunt romani donec continuis quasi victoriis usi reliqua sive caput sive cornu penitus subegerant ab hac igitur graeciae occupatione putandum est initium regni quarti non ab ultima quae aegypti fuit devicta cleopatravide la l b cap sublata carthagine quae tam diu aemul romam imp rii fuit manus suas totum em terra marique porrexit c nam ubi regnum graecanicum primum exortum est ibi fatum quoque suum excidium accepisse aequum est existimare unde videmus prophetam nusquam regnum graecorum quamvis de regibus ejus singillatim egerat ultra antiochum epiphanem produxisse quia nimirum ab eo tempore romanus ordinem suum capessebat quaternione prophetico que id irco qui secuti sunt asiae aut aegypti reges eorum rationem hac regia chronologia deinceps non habendam esse imo quod observari volo ipso prophetae textu tyranni antiochi expresse statuitur fine regni graecorum c v nonlatin alphabet fine regni ipsorum id est graecorum exsurget rex durus facie intelligens aenigmata c scilicet de quo visione dicit quod usque ad principem exercit coelestis magnificaret se jugem cultum tolleret abjiceret habitaculum sanctuarii illius c v et hucusque quidem argumentum hoc mihi optime processit nec usquam impingere visum est non est tamen diffitendum habuisse olim porphyrium habere etiam qui nostro primum aevo contra totius ecclesiae inde ab initio per tot secula consensum opinionem porphyrianam ab inferis revocarunt quod disputationi huic opponant graecorum nimirum regnum non unum sed duo esse regna alterum ipsius alexandri quod tertium est quaternione prophetico alterum successorum ejus quod quartum est ultimum regnum danielis regnum igitur romanum tanquam fabula jam transacta superveniens ab hoc numero penitus excludendum esse contra hanc interpretationem sic insurgo quod unica bestia adumbratum est id unicum est regnum non duo regna scilicet alioquin unica bestia esset duae bestiae quod ab omni ratione alienum est iam vero omne regnum graecorum tam alexandri quam successorum ejus unica bestia adumbratur ergo c minorem leges apud danielem cap vers aries inquit angelus bicornis quems vidisti sunt reges mediae persiae

unius ejusdemque hirci cornu ideoque unius regni potestates ecquis jam dixerit bestiam cornu ejus esse duas bestias judice ipse merebitur illis annumerari ne tertia desit bestia inquient potuit propheta aut spiritus sanctus quod hic unum facit regnum ideoque una figurat bestia alibi tamen pro arbitrio duo facere duabus adumbrare bestiis sed respondeo non arbitrii re est sed veritatis ut unum sit duo duo unum neque deus potest efficere ut cornu cornu sit nihilominus bestia unitas regni ipsa rei veritate posita est signo non pendet si igitur hoc verum est unicum esse regnum non duo tum falsum erit duo esse regna non unum ut qui alterutrum affirmaverit alterum sine mendacio affirmare nequit et quorsum quaeso prophetia quae duo principio regna repraesentasser postea unum confunderet
