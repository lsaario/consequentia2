first intend chapter speak later opening proposition god hath introduced principle eternal nature proposition find explained following particular first place say god hath introduced eternal nature understand blessed trinity father son holy ghost introduced eternal nature father intellectual seeing eye son flaming heart love holy ghost outflowing acting power secondly say god introduced c include eternal wisdom god introduced together principle eternal nature third place god introduced eternal nature together essential love holy nature trinity according apostle iohn god love object may object divine nature doth consist love also light life attributed holy trinity well love sol answer love sense take doth include light life essential love light life neither death darkness come near must know essential love unchangeable nature trinity therefore must think divine nature changed brought clothed upon eternal nature love turned wrath meekness severity mean god love eternal nature quest say reconciled scripture attribute wrath anger severity iustice god an answer scripture speaks god anger wrath severity hath regard god manifesting eternal nat infected defiled sin whereas say manifestation god nature love speak nature purity infected fall lucifer form property harmonized penfect concord vnity state nothing love unchangeable nature god found eternal nature principle last place say god introduced seven spirit throne together eternal nature else seven spirit could never seen manifested eternal nature principle scripture oft make mention introduced eternal nature represented iohn first chap revelation existing mountzion new ierusalemprinciple brought forth eternal nature thus much shall suffice spoken first part subject proposition god proceed praedicate

third last particular foregoing proposition may need explication word introduced understood sense take place say holy trinity introduced eternal nature mean nothing else vnion blessed trinity eternal nature eternal nature union blessed trinity full meaning god introduction eternal nature principle deity subsists eternal humanity eternal humanity subsists union deity god nature nature god thus god nature one another becaus god hath introduced divine nature love eternal nature pure principle nature vnion shall explain open following particular first say vnion god eternal nature true real essential intimate vnion every union three thing found meet together viz uniter thing united union self joyns uniter united together union god eternal nature vniter blessed trinity thing vnited principle eternal nature vnion divine nature love love link tye uniter united essential love deity wherefore vnion must need essential intimate union kind incorporation vniter vnited penetrating mixing one another therefore vnion god eternal nature love essence compared nuptial vnion becaus god hath espoused himsel ith eternal nature pure spotless undefiled virgin indissoluble band band essential love second place vnion god eternal nature eternal vnion sooner principle eternal nature brought forth holy trinity introduced foundation angelical world laid consequently eternity quo ad no

may changed an answer denying god love changed anger eternal nature stand purity perfection coming sin becaus state neither eternal nature thing could subject god anger hatred severity iustice wherefore tho fallen nature perceive effect god love hatred mercy iustice sweetness severity yet pure nature god hath introduced concerning speak nothing ever found effect unchangeable love unchangeable love bond make inseparable union god pure nature deity humanity love vital manner doth pas penetrate every part eternal nature eternal nature presseth love make vnion intimate vital inseparable may say shall separate god pure nature disannul eternal covenant betwen yet notwithstanding hath said concerning union god pure nature principle understand vnion without confusion god pure nature pure nature god tho one yet god comprehends nature nature cannot comprehend deity quest may enquired end motif blessed trinity introduced entred intimate union pure nature principle an enquiry shall answer following particular reas trinity brought forth pure nature principle manifestation tho manifested simplified spirit still eternity yet desired manifestation creature lay hid womb eternal nature reason enter vnion reas second motive reason holy trinity might glorifie exalt divine na ure eternal love world creature brought forth womb eternal nature still eternity indeed infinite number simplified spirit dwelling cen er love glorifie exalt divine nature love design god eternal love glorified exalted infinite variety creature being might several rank according several capacity exalt

sixth reason god introduced eternal nature glorification nature mean union divin essence love told one main reason trinity introduced nature manifesting glory divine nature come tell glorification nature nature might exalted highest degree glory capable union deity eternal nature indeed essence pure spotless glory union hath deity penetrates communicates glory unto glorifying end nature might thus made partaker divine glory pleased holy trinity enter unite eternal nature reas last reason holy trinity united eternal nature might e supreme acting governing moving power throughout pure
