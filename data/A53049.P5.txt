alteration nay see earth active several production alteration particular name coelestial light observation firm argument prove matter animate selfmoving onely degree motion part move flower quicker hereupon former thought answered difference consisted onely grossness dulness inanimate part since sensitive animate part labouring inanimate selfmotion thattheir motion flower animate part would obstruct cross oppose action one would slow quick latter thought replied slowness quickness motion would cause obstruction said man ride horse carried away horse motion nevertheless also motion neither horse man transfer exchange motion hinder obstruct one another former thought answerd true motion could transferred one body another without matter substance several selfmoving part might joined act part without least hinderance one another part one composed creature example man bound one action evident proof creature composed part reason different action nay onely part selfmoving part

motion cannot move none moved motion animate animate must necessity transfer motion able move innate motion might move communicated motion former thought answered resolved question heretofore example horse man man moved carried along horse without communication translation motion horse man also stick said carried man hand go along man without receiving motion hand latter thought replied man stick part creature nature consist commixture animate selfmoving matter move motion even time carried along part inanimate part matter selfmotion could way move say well answered former thought part nature whensoever move move motion prof particular creature effect composed nature act upon another one onely occasion another move thus thus mentioned example horse move man occasion onely move manner also hand move stick onely occasion stick move thus stick move motion told understood part composed body nature nature creature effect consist also commixture forementioned degree animate inanimate matter discourse part compose body nature make former part none said moved moving selfmotion within inanimate part matter considered ingredient nature way moving always moved former part effect body nature distinction sake may called effective part animate inanimate may called constitutive part nature follow composition nature essential part constitute body nature whereof animate reason selfmotion always active perceptive inanimate neither active perceptive dull passive may plainly perceive added former thought alledged example stick animal motion yet carried along animal wheresoever go inanimate matter although motion yet go along animate part wheresoever theyl onely difference told stick composed animate well inanimate matter cannot properly said moved occasioned motion animal carry inanimate part cannot said occasioned moved later thought replied alledged example carried stick could give full satisfaction yet said put case stick motion yet visible exterior local progressive motion animal therefore must need receive motion animal carry nothing occasioned self former answered first although animal visible exterior progressive motion yet progressive motion animal motion next said creature often occasion others alter motion ordinary extraordinary effect wonder said cheese root fruit c produce worm wonder animal occasion visible progressive motion vegetable mineral sort creature natural action said local stirring hair breadth nay atome composition division contraction dilation nay even retention local motion thing measure vary le nay perception

creature would alike shape form figure knowledge perception production dissolution c contradicted experience later thought asked came inanimate part matter degree animate former answered animate part two degree wit sensitive rational inanimate grosser purer density rarity softness hardness c nothing various composition division part particular effect density hardness made grossness thinness rarity part made fineness purity gold dense dross yet pure fine probable said rarest composition suddenly altered grossness fineness part nature without animate inanimate matter dulness one degree poise

magnitude bigger bigger degree nothing else effect selfmoving matter made composition part cannot attributed one single part thing nature b belong infinite part nature joined one body matter self degree animate inanimate selfmoving active perceptive dull passive moved degree later thought asked since nature part closely joined one body possible could finite single part former answered finite single part one single part said subsist neither properly called part rather finite whole meer contradiction say single part reference consequently body nature call finite part nothing else several corporeal figurative motion make difference figure part nature kind sort particular thus finite particular part one called thus reason limited circumscribed figure discerned single figure joined one body part one infinite whole nature figure one part matter change according part change composition division nature atome material atome would property body dividable composable subject infinite change although infinite bulk later thought replied finite body could infinite composition division nature need infinite bulk quantity besides said sense reason finite infinite effect former answered first infiniteness nature certain nature consisted infinite part must need also infinite bulk quantity soever infinite number part figure must also infinite whole since whole part differ really onely manner conception conceive part nature composed one body inseparable composition called whole conceive different figure action change dividable amongst call part one part discerned part example

infinite way selfmoving power nature short said whole nothing composition part part nothing division whole next infinite composition division finite whole said probable finite infinite effect actually divided infinite part yet body cannot propriety body long last therefore finite body last eternally would eternally retain effect rather propriety body dividable composable selfmotion actually divided composed composition division part would eternal eternal infinite therefore sense one cannot say amiss might eternal composition division part finite whole wheresoever selfmotion rest mistake u mean

soon removed part join part nothing else composition division part composition division infinite part nature hinders actual division composition finite part one counterbalance finite understand single part thing nature since call finiteness part nothing else difference change figure caused selfmotion therefore say infinite nature consists infinite number finite part mean part may distinguished discerned several figure figure constant change perpetually body nature constant figure allowed part although last longer others later thought desired know whether degree motion well matter former answered without question degree motion rational part agil quick subtil corporeal action sensitive reason purer finer degree matter free labouring inanimate part withal told several different opposite action nature hindred running extreams degree matter could possibly animate inanimate neither could degree go beyond matter become immaterial truth said balance action nature cannot otherwise must passive degree matter opposite active passive part call inanimate though closely intermixt body nature cannot separated power god nevertheless sense reason may perceive distinct degree distinct

disturbance nature look upon wellordered government find particular often strife difference yet government orderly peaceable later thought replied although several contrary action nature disturb government yet moving severally one composed figure one time proved motion figure body could one thing former answered sufficiently declared heretofore matter either moving moved viz animate part selfmoving inanimate moved carried along animate degree part matter closely intermixt body nature could separated constitute one body onely general also every particular least part least could nay call atome without commixture wheresoever inanimate also animate matter animate matter nothing else corporeal selfmotion difference could apprehended said two degree wit animate inanimate part matter animate part selfmotion one thing could much conceived differently since animate matter corporeal selfmotion thorowly intermixt inanimate part one body like soul body make one man else impossible creature could composed consist dissolved matter without motion could composition dissolution figure named creature motion without matter immaterial motion part reason regular believe naturally nothing produce natural something besides said material immaterial quite opposite ti impossible commix work together act one upon nay could would make confusion contrary nature wherefore probable perception regular sense reason otherwise selfmoving matter corporeal figurative selfmotion act govern wisely orderly easily poising cr ballancing extreams proper fit opposition could done immaterials
