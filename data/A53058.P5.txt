pressure part upon part make perception although matter power selfmotion much composeable divideable part joyn part yet doth make perception nay several part betwixt perception made may distance

dream outside awake although rational sensitive matter inseparably joyned mixed together yet always work together oftentimes rational work without sensitive paterns sensitive without rational paterns mistake madam absolutely confine sensitive perception organ rational brain whole body may work whole body according motion neither say perception eye sight ear hearing forth sensitive organ perception besides sensitive rational motion irregular part perception made example two forementioned men see hear neither see hear perfectly one motion perfect others irregular erroneous one see hears better sensitive rational motion move regularly make perfecter paterns eye ear see better hear regularly perfectly ear eye hear better see may said man singly one man may see better perfectly may see man may hear better perfectly may hear whereas perception made pressure would mistake besides hard pressure object opinion would rather annoy obscure inform soon object removed perception made sensitive motion organ ceaseth reason sensitive motion cease paterning yet rational motion always cease suddenly sensitive corporeal motion work inanimate matter therefore cannot retain particular figure long whereas rational matter doth onely move substance part matter upon none book philosophical opinion inform better thus perception opinion made pressure specie matter going either organ object object

pressing part deny sensitive rational perception sensitive rational motion body mind made pressure outward object pressing sensitive organ brain interior part body would cause dent hole therein make

heretofore also find self able enough give satisfactory answer perhaps expect since command powerful hardly resist nature good easily pardon thing amiss venture upon according strength natural reason endeavour give opinion well clearly first question whether action one producer onely cause natural production generation without imparting transferring substance matter answer sole coaction producer may make change exterior form figure produce another creature substance matter well action transferred together would new creature made old matter every production would require new matter impossible one matter infinite certainly humane sense reason may well perceive one matter several kind matter would make confusion thus new creature made onely substanceless motion would onely infinite trouble nature create something nothing perpetually said would make confusion amongst nature work several part creature reason one matter infinite eternel matter selfmotion matter motion must necessity transmigrate transferred together without separation one thing wit corporeal motion ti true one part animate selfmoving matter may without translation move rather occasion part move one creature cannot naturally produce another without transferring corporeal motion well observed great difference action nature action generating patterning transforming like transforming action may without translation nothing else change motion one part part matter wit part matter change several figure return figure also action patterning without translation pattern nothing else imitate make figure substance part matter like another figure generation every producer doth transfer matter motion corporeal motion produced producer one contribute produced one creature produce many creature many creature partake le producer may say producer transfer matter rather corporeal motion produced many production soon dissolve producer become sacrifice offspring answer doth follow one creature contribute one creature creature contribute although one manner way diver manner way manner way must translation repair assist creature subsist alone self creature traffick commerce must necessity

necessity onely inseparable one body wit corporeal motion motion dividing composing several part acting variously cause production generation metamorphosing thing done nature according author sole action cause generation without transferring substance matter useless none little effect opinion probable second question whether production generation animal conception brain learned say immaterial answer conception brain opinion immaterial corporeal though corporeal motion brain matter conception invisible humane creature brain dissected matter found yet doth prove matter gross substance

creature produced generated way metamorphosing sixth question whether whole may made part answer whole nature except call nature self whole creature part infinite matter seventh question whether animal also vegetable made generated way egg said heretofore probable different sort nay different kind creature one manner way production nature make different way production well different creature vegetable seed likened unto egg egg may well likened seed peascod hen pea cod cluster egg like ear corn animal produce one creature seed time may like kernel nut shell broke creature come forth agree

whether transferred hand ball return short answer motion example bowl moved bowl motion hand threw hand cannot transfer motion hath material self bowl thing handle touch move else hand would short time become weak useless losing much substance unless new motion fast created expended youl say perhaps hand bowl may exchange motion bowl motion doth enter hand supply motion went hand bowl close joyning touch thing moving moved must joyning mover moved either immediate mean another body answer probable hand give impart motion bowl receive none bowl reason motion cannot transferred without matter inseparably united one thing cannot think probable animate selfmoving matter hand quits hand enters bowl animate matter bowl leaf bowl enters hand selfmoving substance readily prepared sudden translation transmigration may say may easily done food received animal body excrement discharged air taken breath sent way respiration creature onely produced subsist act others assistance answer true creature power strength joyned assistance every part single subsisted self part assist side part resist though unity nature infinite matter yet division also infinite part infinite matter cause antipathy much sympathy equal assistance well resistance cause conformity whole nature infinite matter contrary rather may say different effect proceeding onely cause onely matter could possibly least much variety nature humane sense reason perceives return first argument may say motion may transferred one body another without transferring matter answer impossible unless motion call nothing nothing transferred cannot imagine indeed sense reason nature conceive nothing conceive nature found youl say perhaps substanceless thing incorporeal immaterial form answer opinion meer contradiction say substanceless thing form surely nature cannot possible motion divided matter may say body whence motion transferred would become le bulk weight weaker every act motion body corporeal motion selfmoving matter received would grow bigger heavier stronger answer reason denies translation motion moving body moved questionless one would grow le bigger loosing much substance receiving nay possible motion could transferred without matter body go would nevertheless grow weaker strength lie motion unless believe motion transferred useless mover onely useful moved else would superfluous moved except say became annihilated transferrd done effect would perpetual infinite creation annihilation substanceless motion could creation annihilation nothing reason cannot conceive neither possible unless nature power god create nothing annihilate nothing truth probable sense reason believe creation something nothing creation nothing nothing wherefore cannot sense reason motion hand transferrd bowl yet say motion hand doth contribute motion bowl though bowl hath natural motion self nature creature know rest perpetual motion though always exterior local yet proper certain motion easily perceived grosser

towards shape figure exteriously yet interiously yet interior natural motion could effect flying ascending without help exterior shape man animal may interior motion bird hath wanting exterior shape cannot fly whereas wing like bird interior natural motion wing might without doubt fly well bird doth sixthly concerning descent heavy body ch forcible ascent light body question truth opinion certainly madam cannot conceive otherwise sense reason though fire rare doth ascend extraordinary quick motion yet motion opinion strong piercing grosser part creature descend difference strength quickness water stronger motion another sort figure fire could suppress fire much le quench smoak heavier flame fly rise rather wherefore still opinion heavy body descend forcibly light body ascend seems rational lastly perceive cannot believe body weight reason sun star would long since coverd earth answer objection say body without figure magnitude consequently without weight bigger atome sun
