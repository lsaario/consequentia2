dominus noster clementissimus debito cum respectu que aestimatione acceptat honorem quo regia majestas magnae britanniae condecorare ipsum voluit transmissis insignibus toto orbe celebratissimi ordinis equitum divi georgii aureae periscetidis sive enim respiciamus antiquitatem inclytissimi ordinis qui jam trecentos triginta novem annos primis suis incunabulis numerat seu gloriam fundatoris edvardi tertii cum omnibus eo fastigio dignis virtutibus tum imprimis inusitata fortitudine ac felicitate clarissim regis sive splendorem ac praestantiam eorum queis istius ordinis honos obligit inter quos multi sublimes monarchae quod jamjam non sine admiratione audiyimus octo imperatores romani quadraginta quin que reges sexaginta electores ut plurimum supremo imperio gaudentes principe praeter plurimos alios non minus splendore natalium quam rerum gestarum gloria celeberrimos hero numerantur sive etiam scopum institute qui praecipue ad defensionem justitiae sublevationem oppressorum cultum verae que infucatae virtutis tendit manifesto deprehendetur isthune nulli alteri ejus generis ordini toto orbe concedere multis autem rebus alios longe antecellere cujus praestantiae infallibile documentum perspicitur duobus palmariis genuini equitis requisitis ut nimirum nunquam proditionis cujuspiam aut quod turpi fuga tergum hosti obverterit insimulari potuerit sed quae ad dignitatem hujus ordinis spectant ea jam domino legato ita luculenter ac solide deducta sunt ut superfluum fuerit eidem aliquid superaddere velle equidem antiqua historia graecorum comprimis romanorum multa licet videre exempla regnorum ac insignium provinciarum possessoribus alios collatorum sed tantorum munerum causa non semper meritum aut jus reperitur saepeista caecum fortuna aut enormi favori debentur aut quia reipublicae rationes ista per alios potius possideri suaserunt ast qui solo virtutis merito nititur ex vera solida que praestantiae aestimatione promanet honos ipsis sceptris coronis que longe praestabilior habendus que eodem modulo quoq collatio inclyti hujus ordinis mensuranda est imprimis cum ea proficiscatur rege cui nil nisi praevia exacta cognitione maturo judicio suscipitur quanquam enim serenitas sua electoralis semper sibi decorum habitura fuerat illustrissimo huic ordini adscribi quod tamen id regia majestate magnae britanniae quae nunc rerum potitur fiat id multis modis gaudium quo ipsius men ex ea perfunditur adauget quin ipsi adamantes aurum queis insignia ordinis radiant multo vividiorem splendorem mutuantur manu tam gloriosi collatoris quam manum divina providentia elegit ad seculum hoc miraculis insigniendum quae tyranni terrorem incutit eorumque insolentiam castigat solo affligit quae oppressos liberat e ruinis sublevat spoliatos restitu titubantes corona stabilit immo quae adhuc calet ab admiranda liberatione duorum regnorum cui de tertio propediem trophaeum statuendum auguramur quae tam augusta manu dantur singulari virtute effectu vacuum esse non possunt velut quae incomparabili sua fortitudine animi que constantia ac coetitus prosperato successu effecit ut celeberrima toto orbe natio quatuor corona ipsius serenissimae consortis reginae omnium virtutum ac gratiarum matris capiti exornando porrexerit quibus coronis tamen divinum lumen quo caput istud circumsunditur plus splendoris affert quam ab iisdem accipit quo illud accedit quod serenitas sua electoralis inter exterros principe prima sit quam regia sua majestas illustri hocce astimationis ac benevolentiae suae signo muneravit ex quo eadem agnoscit quod licet jam antea regia sua majestas serenitas sua electoralis sanctissimo sanguinis propinquae cognationis vinculo divinitus sint combinatae regia tamen majestas isthanc necessitudinem isthoc ordinis ligamine arctius adhuc ad stringere praeclarum duxerit nec dubitare fa est quin istud ex occulta operatione divinae providentiae promanarit ut cum hic ordo primum ab edvardo tertio institutus fuerit quidem praecipue contra gallos qui jam tum insolentiam dominandi libidinem qua nunc totum fere orbem subversum eunt parturiebant idem nunc guilielmo tertio fridericum tertium conferatur eo quidem tempore quo hi duo primo signum ad excutiendum quod europae cervicibus imminebat jugum sustulerunt ac junctis animis viribus que immani ac truculento isti hosti sese objecerunt auspicatissimis victoriarum monumentis symboli quo hic utitur omen firmaturi hony soit qui mal pense dedecore obrutus pereat qui insolubilem hanc conjunctionem contemnere aut temerare aurus fuerit quo etiam sine dubio pro solita sibi sapientia respexit regia sacrum majestas cum serenitati suae electorali gladium qui alias cum ordinis insignibus transmitti non solet ad insignia ordinis haud spectat antea nemini equitum oblatus fuit offerri eodem que illam tanta solennitate accingi jusserit ut nimirum eodem belli periculorum societate ad asserendam europae libertatem jugo gallico uteretur sane serenitas sua electoralis regiae suae majestatis scopum ad quem delato hocce honore collimat ex asse implebit eadem ita arcte regiae suae majestati sese obstrictam judicabit ut nulla vi aut frau ad eam divellendam valitura sit quaecun que regiae suae majestati prospere aut secus evenerint sibi quo que accidisse judicabit deni que regiae suae majestatis proprias rationes non alio discrimine habebit quam quodistis cura prior que locus deferendus sit de caetero serenitas sua electoralis delato hocce honore nunquam sese indignum reddet ac statuta ordinis memori semper mente tenebit et quia serenitas sua electoralis nunc inter membra ordinis recepta est ab inclyta natione anglicana instituti hujus gloria emolumentum eidem semper quam maxime cordi erunt ad extremum serenitas sua electoralis dominis legatis gratias agit quod officium tam egregii acceptissimi muneris offerendi se suscipere voluerunt eidem gratissimum est sua regia majestate istos potissimum huic functioni obeundae delectos quos qua aestimatione affectu sua serenitas electoralis prosequatur nulla occasione demonstrare omittet finis
