construction word diverse habitude one would prove aristotle book made changing order construction thus one doth see true saw thomas drunk therefore true thomas drunk sentence hath proper metaphorical sense thus laugh mouth meadow laugh therefore meadow mouth belong proverbial speech may resolved shewing ambiguity sentence fallacy composition word joined together disjoined contrary unto fallacy division word severed ought joined together may happen four way dictum modal proposition may put whole self part self example possible sitting run proposition false taken together doth sit cannot actually run disjoined true doth sit another time may run hypothetical proposition whose part joined conjunction copulative disjunctive two three even odd five two three therefore five even odd word sentence may joined diverse thing example may truly said born born hour man threescore year old may truly said born therefore man threescore year old born hour two thing taken severally premiss conjunctly conclusion contrary thus dog father dog therefore dog father four term resolved separating divided sense compounded shewing true genuine fallacy accent one word sentence doth signifie diverse thing reason different accent manner pronunciation may four way making wrong pronunciation long syllable short contrary diverse writing without diphthong aspiration thus could pronounce shibboleth safe gileadites ephramites could pronounce shibboleth therefore safe one word made two two one changing manner pronunciation thus saith well done doth acknowledge action good derides

opposition happeneth disputation thing socrates rich compared codrus poor compared craesus therefore socrates poor rich reference blackamore white every blackamore white reference teeth therefore blackamore white taken manner socrates doth run freely socrates doth run freely therefore socrates doth doth run reference time faithful law believe christ come faithful gospel believe christ come

fallacy cause cause brought true cause either cause else cause accident like unto effect happens true cause brought true one would prove war cruel war appearance comet cause accident brought true one would prove use wine forbidden maketh men drunk fallacy useful syllogism drive respondent something impossible solved denying false cause shewing true fallacy consequent inferred antecedent consequent
