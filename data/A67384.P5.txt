weight simply considered would stayed impetus imnpressed precedent motion thus far principle good objection pervert sense never intended first introducers next would ask meant water place particularly whether water pond artificially contrived top tower place though hole bottom ought run place reason fails even diver shall feel weight water thames place somewhat else make weight felt avoid therefore like instance explain meaning doth gravitate thing specifically lighter self explication apply answer neither hold manifest use ordinary instance vessel pierced near bottom fig 12 13 run fuller stronger stream middle near top full half almost empty argues pressure upper part upon near vent say press intermediate part onely air without meer evasion remoter part water cannot press air pressing like crowd distance cannot thrust door thrusting pole cannot thrust end thrusting pole rope draw fastened drawing rope yet signal difference trusion traction trusion sufficeth thing contiguous though connexion traction must connexion strong enough else string break weight follow though heap sand suffice press scale yet rope sand serve draw therefore mr line funiculus explication torricellian experiment must somewhat texture well contiguity give strength without able sustain weight suspended quicksilver certainly part fluid able draw one another much able thrust one another one gravitate

supposed crassitude viscosity present case consider much porringer weighs water consider onely whether remove much weight though never slowly swiftness remove little weight move suffice main objection lye point porringer weighs heavy depth 12 1 inch c depth 25 40 inch fig 16 say ought every thing weighs water much weight heavier much water instance plain δδ fig 16 part equally pressed confessedly

depth contrary experiment therefore make great plausible objection man water feel weight saith man body heavier much water water doth gravitate reason school speak non causa pro causa question water doth raise body would much wood reason good much water doth press downward body doth therefore able press away question man doth feel hurt put pain answer specifically lighter serve 1 man reason feel weight wood proportionably lighter yet find man much sink load wood load lead equal weight said though man yet air lighter wood say therefore cause onely lateral pressure air direct pressure man though man stood neck water yet find burden wood laid shoulder notwithstanding man proportionably heavier wood shall equally feel equal weight lead water circumjacent air make wood weigh upon man 2 though whole man heavier much water yet many part lighter would swim water though connexion heavier made sink like wood tyed piece lead part least ought feel pain specifick gravity onely cause

heavier body learned author hath two expedient salving indolence man water feeling pain weight first supposing brickwork fig 18 without mortar brick taken bottom would hereupon sink pillar base onely kind pyramid rest manner arch mutually supported thence supposeth middle brick bear weight column onely pyramid pyramid taken away rest would gravitate upon cavity like manner supposeth must brick grain wheat yea sand consequently lesser particle even water supposeth would thus support without gravitating proceeds upon several mistake first supposeth middle brick taken away rest fall therefore bore nothing weight argue beam fig 19 supported three post middle post removed fall therefore bear nothing beam weight table fig 20 supported five six leg stand though one taken away therefore leg bear nothing consequently leg leg therefore none bear weight whereas bear part thereby ease rest absence one must bear whole space filled support would equivalent intire body breadth would bear without considerable difference much case fluid onely add one leg weak bear proportional part yet rest much able bear weak one break relieved rest secondly admitting brikwork would yet onely upon account part brick hang coherent part supported cannot fall without breaking brick easily separable part part brick brick case fluid part would fall well middle brick consequently pyramid column rather thirdly whereas argues brick grain wheat thence sand consequence hold shorter brick le hang layer instance brick lye two inch brick half long would lye one inch consequently supposing thickness pyramid base would twice great twice tall still overhangings decrease pyramid increaseth till length overhangings come nothing case fluid pyramid becomes column even heap wheat fig 21 pile brick remove much bottom find instead pyramid base fall column part inverted pyramid heap approach nature fluid argument another expedient shall speak lower part must bear le column incumbent found otherwise tube filled moist calicesand gravitate wedged could fall perfect fluid suppose lastly doth explication destroy hypothesis grant pail water instance part well upper lower gravitate bottom though whereas upper part supported brickarch gravitate cavity much le gravitate bottom cavity supposeth great heap wheat would break empty eggshell wheat want weight gravitation grain intangled fall right like heap bush one would bear another though gravitate liquid otherwise suppose partible every point however eggshell happen prove serf hypothesis air eggshell lighter wheat lye ought gravitate principle break eggshell archwork eggshell defended want gravitation gravitation surmounted greater strength like great weight hang strong tack heavy scale supported great weight support underneath thousand like accident expedient lateral pressure supposeth fluid whereby supposeth perpendicular pressure abated proceeds upon mistake also though true water flow upon declivity yet fluid heavy see bowl run hill though fluid solid body broad solid lying narrow pillar fig 22 hath every part lateral pressure well water cut middest fall either side water would doth reason want propension lateral propension checked impeded greater strength cohesion like perpendicular propension checked greater strength pillar like pillar weak break perpendicular weight strength cohesion le lateral propension solid divide fluid would solid break weight fig 23 contrary water pail vessel though fluid hath lateral propension restrained side vessel greater strength doth lose side chance strong enough break doth least endeavor though strong enough solid fluid particle hath lateral propension well perpendicular though sometimes restrained overpowered cohesion part strength side case strength weak propension prevails lateral propension fluid kept side vessel utmost part inner part keep lateral pressure fig 24 sustained b greater equal strength cannot thrust away b without thrusting body heavy self b thrust away lateral pressure part mutually sustained perpendicular pressure part hence come pas underpart bear onely pressure column expedient intimated therefore heap wheat mentioned though upon aperture bottom fall pillar gone lateral pressure rest doth operate yet pillar part bottom bear expedient serve reason ask man water feel weight would answer first agreed great depth man shall feel pain hear mr gratrix contrived way taking breath great depth water long pipe reaching top yet found breast compressed water could draw breath small depth water deny man may remain time without considerable pain reason judge man incompassed fluid whether specifically heavier lighter make matter equally pressed side thereby suffers luxation part consequently sense pain upon luxation laceration part especially nervous part pain ariseth hence flesh feel hardness bone fitted thereunto suffer luxation laceration bone broken dislocated shall find hurt u feel hard sharp though body compression may contracted le room reason air blood springy liquid yet uniformly pressed without tearing nervous part suffers nothing pain hence eggshell mentioned though pressed body specifically heavier self therefore according principle ought crushed receives prejudice equally pressed side doth easily sustain reason round form nature continued arch find experience round glass though equal thickness bear much greater pressure without within flatsided pressure side onely concur eggshell situated pressed onely upon one side le pressure would break add also though perfect fluid arching yet heap solid wheat something nature grain bigger conveniently shaped may therefore help bear burden like 4 5 leg table mentioned strong enough supply defect one weak one therefore broken though strong enough self bear part heap approacheth nature fluid le room arching perfect fluid none hence also spunge though lighter water flaccid also yet though fastened bottom vessel crushed together weight incumbent water water within pore doth bear side great strength without would press like see lung taken animal immersed water account serf pressure air animal air within pressing strongly outward

confessed compressed air intensively heavier speak specifically heavier ballance found lighter therefore positive quality heaviness lightness positive gravity air thus evinced consequently air ascends onely thrust body heavy like water riseth upon casting earth heavier body torricellian experiment like phaenomena easily solved statical principle without recourse fuga vacui admitting vessel nose

without recourse fuga vacui thus far ancient would agree u never flye fuga vacui long visible weight force thrust fluid gave occasion introduce notion fuga vacui two experiment reducible thereunto wherein want force raise liquid way trusion recourse traction ne detur vacuum first suction pump syrinx like occasion syphon whereby liquor carried considerable height level nose syringe immersed

yet lower though self begin run yet suction otherwise set running current continue till either sunk low let air c lower outward orifice reason whereof say since appears force thrust must need bo flowing weight cb follow contrary propension gravity vacuum must need ensue therefore suppose nature doth abhor answer say first foundation nature prove abhorrence onely experiment otherwise known onely invented expedient serve turn otherwise solve phaenomenon shew force think need expedient abhorrence must either gratis dictum without cogent proof evidence must shewed introduce aware subsidiary proof late invented ground introducing opinion therefore without disputing whether nature cannot admit vacuum shall onely shew need notion business next fuga vacui cause water thus rising pump syphon thus argue ought hold height whatever pump instance must draw water hundred foot high syphon convey water highest hill tower argument equally hold whether height b two foot two hundred foot bo flow cb follow vacuum must insue equally either case consequence argument clear confidence thereof ancient doubt would none know till galilaeos time ever questioned assigned determinate height beyond pump would draw water syphon would convey surprising discovery wholly unexpected end last century first found experience water could thus drawn higher 34 foot say 34 foot much alters temperature air air light much exceed 32 foot heavy may reach 35 foot experiment alone evidently evince supposed fuga vacui infinite determinate strength put galilaeo upon inquiry whether cause fuga vacui would drawn high higher happily lighted hypothesis countergravitation incumbent air hath since improved torricellio others rationally argued countergravitation air would countervail weight 34 foot water ought lighter liquor countervail greater height le height heavier found upon experiment little difference chance sometime discovered accounted different constitution air u little accident many recounted particularly water would raised 34 foot quicksilver height 29 inch mean 28 29 30 air temperature doth vary agrees proportion specifick weight liquid quicksilver near upon 14 time heavy water torricellian experiment take name experiment thus administred fig 36 glasspipe closed bottom filled quicksilver inverted orifice stopped finger otherwise till immersed vessel stagnant quicksilver opened height pipe stagnant quicksilver 29 inch thereabouts remain full cause hereof say ne detur vacuum quicksilver sink way air enter would ensue vacuum nature abhors cause say weight incumbent air already proved heavy equivalent weight 29 inch quicksilver therefore defended closed glass suppose otherwise held firm pressure weight counterpressure sustained height pipe stagnant quicksilver 29 inch pipe sink height e leaving space glass void quicksilver whether filled imperceptible fluid dispute reason sink ancestor assigned aware phaenomenon thought ne detur vacuum would remain full whatever height tube modern de carte might avoid vacuum imagine materia subtilis sense make dicovery piercing pore glass supply place supply place e give quicksilver leave sink low might well comein relieve rest give leave sink find others linus imagine weight 29 inch quicksilver doth stretch part upper surface subtile matter thin yet fill seemingly void space le weight serve stretch fall lower stretched matter like funiculus hold rest ne detur vacuum weight stretch small part prodigiously thin stretch rest rather give moderate tensure whole remember assign reason others suppose funiculus made stretching upper part quicksilver squeezing subtil part whole body like vapour fill seemingly void space le weight would squeeze therefore fall lower fall liquor whatever never different texture weight thus dissolvable rather require greater lesser weight thus resolve squeeze assign reason yet find since lighter liquor greater height must allowed proportion greater make equivalent weight cause say seems simple unforced account counterpressure air equivalent 29 inch much able sustain much weight sustain whatever liquor whether specifically lighter heavier whether firm looser texture therefore height sink lower ancient aware find air hath positive gravity consequently though small proportion body yet great height air may countervail lesser height heavier liquor like see greater height water countervail lesser height quicksilver would presume troubled fuga vacui said roundly weight air full height equivalent water height 34 foot quicksilver 29 inch proportionably fluid consequently pump syringe embolus sucker defended air pressure exposed fig 34 pressure raise b much weight water quicksilver fluid equivalent pressure manner e equally exposed air pressure quantity oyl poured would raised weight water quicksilver equivalent thereunto like account give syphon pressure fig 35 raise fluid height b greater described thence fall weight yet higher air pressure would thrust b supposing pipe big air could conveniently pas liquor pipe would fall weight bo would le gravitate ba yet air pressure would much yet considerable objection removed viz air closed vessel though great height pressing surface stagnant quicksilver fig 37 sustain high pillar thereof closed tube suppose ae exposed open air whereas yet weight ad within vessel defended vessel pressure incumbent air cannot equal weight whole height atmosphere reason air spring always equivalent pressure lying upon consequently spring air ordinary constitution u must equivalent weight incumbent air le air incumbent would yet press closer spring would relax self thrusting away presseth air included spring must therefore press great strength equivalent weight like spring acb fig 38 pressed weight tensure bear spring remaining weight taken away hand put place would press hard hand sustain weight force equal weight sustained thus bowed put vessel fig 39 would force press side present case air included doth press spring force incumbent air gave tensure yet evident airpump part air pumped thereby rest le compressed quicksilver tube fig 37 sink e lower station f g lower lower air pumped spring thereby relaxed spring grows weaker le able support weight quite destroys evasion mentioned seeming void space filled thin substance weight 29 inch quicksilver 34 foot water le
