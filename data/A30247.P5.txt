put first nature substantial nature natural propagation let u therefore consider much implied expression sect ii first may well called natural doth infect whole nature mankind defilement followeth specifical individual even call death natural followeth mankind rich men die poor men die learned men die foolish none exempted thus also sinne born natural way mankind contagion sonnes nobleman prince though glory blood descent yet full sin child wrath well child basest though civil respect boast birth others yet theological divine respect alike yea child godly parent though promise seed respect child said holy cor yet come world inherent corruption generate child godly men corrupt men austin old expressed circumcised man begat child uncircumcised husbandman though soweth seed chaff

death accidental follow individual nature thus sinnes follow particular nature man actual sinnes every man drunkard adulterer defiled one way another sinne followeth whole universal nature man original sinne though every man guilty particular sinne yet original sinne therefore schoolman say actual sinne doth corrumpere personam original naturam actual sin corrupt person original nature sect iii declaring naturality original sinne ingredient constitutive nature universal inseparable pollution adhering say death though praeter naturam contra yet regard principle mortality every man death natural come therefore second demonstration naturality evil seen inward principle sinfull motion soul per se per accidens great part definition aristotle giveth nature may moral sense apply purpose first say inward principle sinfull motion working soul nature stone cause motion downward nature fire cause fire motion operation thus original sinne intrinsecal cause root actual evil guilty farre

man hath power see hear actually either moral thing action habit natural toad vent poison honey man sinneth natural inabled thing good wholly grace say inward principle sinne within u distinguish external cause viz devil wicked men sometimes may tempt cause sinne therefore devil called tempter mat insomuch made question whether sinne man commits devil hath tempted unto attend time enough devil outward cause sinne therefore original filth u spark could never kindle fire cannot compell force sinne somuch whatsoever sinne commit lay fault principally upon devil corrupt heart though ananias lied holy ghost devil filled heart juda betrayed christ satan entred heart yet devil could come heart uncleane corrupt constitution evil heart therefore devil took possession apostle james cap doth
