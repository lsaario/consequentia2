virgin mary appears word speaking disciple joh saith shall see son man ascending bread god cometh heaven came heaven mine butjoh sent came forth father come world leave world go father real existence son god born blessed virgin mary proved clearly argument whosoever john baptist abraham space time christ man begotten virgin mary jesus christ son god really existent john baptist abraham appeareth

truly properly god subsisting form god thought equal god thought could deceived injurious god must necessity truly essentially god equality divine essence infinite whatsoever finite christ may see word form god thought phil robbery equal god emptied took upon form servant made likeness man word naturally result three proposition fully demonstrating assertion first christ form servant soon made
