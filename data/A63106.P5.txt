gospel one commandment joh saviour came fulfil law whereas said old time thou shalt forswear thy self c saviour saith say unto thou shalt forswear thy self destroy law indeed leaveth stand addeth unto also said namely neither shalt thou swear vainly though indirectly e god heaven earth c indirect kind swearing jew devised purpose favour fond humour swearing make light thing saith calvin whole law agreeth gospel condemning vice also commanding vertues part messias coming take away nothing moral law explain reform restore thing saith ireneus christ fulfilled natural moral thing law setting clearly fully saith st hierom even painter making picture making second draught doth blot first illustrate make plain doth saviour christ doth law still law fully amply set forth second edition
