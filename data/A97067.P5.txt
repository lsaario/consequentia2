propositionem singularem vim universalis non habere respondeo primo eodem argumento probari posse non esse particularem quia neque propositio particularis affirmata negata opponuntur contradictorie sed subcontrarie earum utraque potest esse vera harum non ita sicui ramus videatur satis cavisse dum syllogismum proprium diversam speciem constituit tam generali quam speciali regero ad hominem male pro ramo arguitur ex ii quae ipse pro nugis habet ex logica sua exulare fecit ille enim de oppositione aequipollentia conversione propositionum nihil habet ut nec de reductione syllogismorum novum praedicandi modum facere non potest cum impossibile sit aliquid de alio dici quod tamen nec de toto necsecundum partem dicatur ut supra fusius explicavimus respondeo secundo non singularibus tantum hoc accidit sed aliis universalibus quibusdam nam materia necessaria impossibili ex negatione affirmatione universali altera semper vera est altera falsa unde regula illa quod contrariarum materia contingenti utraque potest esse falsa idem accidit propositionibus factis per omne collectivum quas tamen universales esse nemo quem scio negavit possent tamen fateor eadem ratione qua negant singulares sunt enim revera universales cum praedicatum non nisi uni antecedenti attribuatur hujusmodi namque propositiones omnes apostoli sunt duodecim omnes apostoli non sunt duodecim item omnes

respondeo tertio ratio hujus contradictionis inter propositionem singularem affirmantem negantem pendet ex necessitate materiae potius quam ex ipsa propositionis natura forma quoties enim subjectum universalis propositionis est divisionis capax ut distributivis de materia contingenti praedicatum sigillatim applicatur subjecti partibus affirmans negans universaliter non opponuntur immediate contradictorie quia licet aliquid de toto non recte affirmetur de parte forsan affirmari poterit ergo nec de toto negabitur ubi vero materiae necessitas particularem praedicationem omnino prohibet necessario requirit ut quod de illo subjecto dicitur dicatur de eo toto ut materia necessaria impossibili universali collectiva ut prositione singulari ibi praedicatum vel de toto dicitur vel de toto

individuo dicitur dicatur nonlatin alphabet impossibile est ut secus esset quin affirmatio negatio sint opposita immediata particularis enim intermedia eo ipso excluditur nec aliunde patet ratio hujus oppositionis immediatae quam ex hoc fundamento vel enim semper nonlatin alphabet praedicatur prout no afferimus vel semper nonlatin alphabet vel aliquando de toto aliquando secundum partem si semperde parte licet de una parte dicatur quid impedit quin de alia negetur ita ut affirmatio negatio sint simul verae cum affirmatio particularis quoad unam partem non impediat negationem partialem quoad aliam partem si aliquando nonlatin alphabet aliquando nonlatin alphabet prout ramistarum doctrina videtur innuere qui quoties una praemissarum propria est eam pro particulari habent non autem si utraque sit propria si sic inquam quamvis gratis dictum sit nec ulla appareat ratio cur haec nonilla sit universalis imo cur eadem promiscue nunc sit universalis nunc particularis oppositio nec sic esset immediata licet enim affirmatio nonlatin alphabet falsa sit posset tamen quoad aliquam partem si aliquando partialiter praedicetur vera esse unde nec negatio nonlatin alphabet vera possent ergo negatio affirmatio simul esse falsae non contradictorie oppositae necesse est igitur ut si opponantur immediate ideo sit quia singularis propositio semper est nonlatin alphabet unde vel de toto

illarum haec ille realis igitur identitas modorum arguit realem identitatem rerum modificatarum ad minorem devenio quod modus quantitatis non differt realiter modo substantiae insto figura situ figura enim est modus quantitatis situs modus substantiae nec tamen differunt realiter quod figura sit modus quantitatis confesso est apud omnes sic smiglecius figura non est terminus quantitatis sed terminorum quantitatis dispositio quid hoc aliud quam modus scheiblerus metaph figura inquit est qualitas modificans quantitatis terminos unde non convenit quantitas ei consequenter nec figura quae modus illius est convenire potest scaliger etiam ait figuram non esse quantitatem sed quantitate suarez item disp n est ergo figura modus quantitatis situm esse modu substantiae non minus patet smigl situs est dispositio partium corporis loco quid hoc aliud quam modus scheiblerus ex stimo inquit situm non significare peculiarem entitatem sed significare modum quendam quae denominatur neque enim apparet indicium unde sumatur realis distinctio unde definit situm accidens secundum quod corpus habet ordinem suarum partium ubi suarez relinquitur inquit ut dicamus situm seu positionem esse aliquem intrinsecum modum corporis situatia quo sic denominatur sedens au jaciens aut aliquid simile est ergo situs modus substantiae figuram vero situm non differre realiter patet nam eadem partium dispositio quae ordine ad totum dicitur figura ordine ad locum dicitur situs quod cum sit tantum respectus rationis non sufficit ad distinctionem ealem imo vix rationis ratiocinatae hinc smiglecius est situs inquit figura quaedam corporis prout existit loco eademque figura ut respicit corpus seipso est figura corporis pertinens ad qualitatem ut vero est figura corporis ordine ad locum se figura positionis partium corporis loco ita pertinet ad praedicamentum situs nec aliter suarez quum enim inter specie situs enumerasset asperum laeve hinc inquit videtur sequi etiam curvum rectum prout praecise oriuntur ex positione partium loco pertinere ad praedicamentum situs quia etiam illae differentia dicunt quandam dispositionem totius consurgentem ex positione partium quod inquit admittere non est magnum inconveniens nam revera statio sessio ratione rectitudinis curvitatis maxime differunt non quod ipsa figura ut sic sit positio seu situs pertineat ad hoc praedicamentum sed illa dispositio totius ordine ad locum secundum talem ordinem partium ex qua sequitur talis figura figura ergo situs quorum illa quantitatis hic substantiae modus est non magi differunt quam ratione quare nec eorum subjecta argumentum tertium entia realiter distincta non possunt fundare undem modum sed substantia quantitas fundant undem modum ergo praecedens argumentum processit de subjectis adaequatis quod duo modi diversis subjectis realiter differant hoc procedit de subjectis partialibus inadaequatis quod duo entia realiter distincta non possint esse subjecta partialia ejusdem modi sed substantia quantitas sunt subjecta partialiae ejusdem numero modi ergo majorem ponit suarez n patet etiam sic enim idem realiter differ et seipso nam situs v g si fundatur substantia simul quantitate cumutrisque identificatur quae si realiter distinguantur quae cum sunt realiter eadem realiter inter se differunt situs si utrisque idem seipso differet dice unio formae cum materia est modus fundatur tamen utroque extremo quae realiter differunt nam materia forma uniuntur quare idem modus rebus realiter distinctis respondeo unio qua uniuntur materia forma non simplex est sed duplex una materia per quam ipsa unitur formae alia forma per quam ipsa unitur materiae sicut relationibus v g socrates plato sunt simile puta albedine non tamen per eandem similitudinem sed per diversam relatum enim correlatum referuntur ad invicem per relationes diversas nec enim relatio patris ad filium eadem est cum relatione filii ad patrem licet relationibus ejusdem nominis re non sit adeo perspicua ratio tamen eadem est habent enim distincta fundamenta sic similitudo socratis ad platonem fundatur albedine socratis similitudo platonis ad socratem albedine platonis quae fundamenta cum sint realiter distincta ita relationes quae cum fundamentis identificantur ut autem socrates plato sunt simile per duas realiter distinctas similitudines ita materia forma uniuntur per duas realiter distinctas uniones si saltem ipsae materia forma realiter distinguantur minor sequitur insubstantia simul quantitate fundatur idem modus quod enim fundatur subst tia quatenus qu ta resultat ex ip quantitate illud fundatur substantia simul quantitate sed sic figura situs ergo quod figura sit modus quantitatis supra ostensum est quod non ultimatim fundetur quantitate quin substantiam modificet patet ex ipsa descriptione quam habet suarez disp n quod sit modus quidam resultans ex corpore ex terminatione magnitudinis est ergo modus corpore resultans ex quatitate substantia pariter quantitate modificans nec enim negari potest ipsum corpus ejusque partes substantiales entitativas quas vocant eandem figurationem eosdem terminos habere quos habet quantitas idem de situ dicendum est quod itus sit modus substantiae ita notum est ut nihil magi quod autem non substantia pura fundetur sed substantia quantum aeque patet smiglecius restri gitur inquit situs ad corpus ad situationem enim requiruntur extensio multitudo partium materialium extensio materialitas non reperiuntur nisi materialibus duo nempe requirit ad situatione extensionem quae est quantitate partes materiales substantia fundatur ergo situs substantia simul quantitate pariter suarez disp eadem ratione negat situm substantiis incorporeis nempe quia partes non habent sed sint otae toto totae qualibet parte figura igitur quae est modus quantitatis situs qui est modus substantiae non fundantur vel substantia sola vel sola quantitate sed substantia simul quantitate seu substantia quantum cum autem idem modus non fundetur diversis realiter subjectis ne quidem partialibus sequitur substantiam quantitatem non esse realiter diversa nec dicendum est unum esse situm substantiae alterum quantit ti si corpus enim tuetur proprio situ sine quantitate idem valet de extens one positione partium extra partes reliquis officiis quan atis quid opus est alia situatione quantitate imo substantia esset quantum sine quantitate situs enim ponit partes extra partes toto quod est formale quantitatis confirmari posset ulterius ex quod figura sit modus quantitatis situs vero modus substantiae figura autem situs non differant realiter nedum modaliter quidem vix ratione ratiocinata idem ergo modus substantia fundatur simul quantitate sed de supra atque hactenus assertio prima assertio secunda probabile est neque modaliter differre substantiam quantitate sed tantum ratione ratiocinata ad distinctionem rationis ratiocinatae requi itur distinctio conceptuum cum unitate indistinctione parte rei hinc suarez n ut distinctio inquit judicetur rationis non rei satis est ut praeter distinctionem conceptuum nullum inveniatur signum ad distinctionem modalem aut realem cognoscendam nam cum distinctiones non multiplicandae sint sine causa sola distinctio conceptuum non sufficiat ad inferendam majorem distinctionem quandocunque cum illa distinctione conceptuu non adjungitur aliud signu majoris distinctionis judicanda semper est distinctio rationis non rei hinc infert quandocunque constat aliqua quae unita conjuncta sunt ita esse conceptibus objectivis distincta ut individuo sint prorsus inseparabilia tam mutuo quam non mutuo tum magnum fere certum est argumentum non distingui actu sed ratione ratiocinata haec ille cum ergo materia quantita nullum appareat signum realis aut quidem modalis distinctionis separationis mutuae vel non mutuae tam ex potentia ordinar quam absoluta cum quantitativa extensio formaliter resultet ex partibus entitativis probabile est non differre plus quam ratione atque hoc concedit suarez paene nisi quod mysterium eucharistiae impediret dist n per mysterium inquit eucharistiae certius nobis constat quantitatem esse rem distinctam materia quam per cognitionem naturalem constare potuisset videmus ergo unde jesuitarum pertinacia de reali quantitatis distinctione ne scilicet periret mysterium transubstantiationis quod illi de fide tenent no pari confidentia negamus adjungam argumentum ipsius suarez quo probat ille durationem non distingui ex parte rei ab existentia rei durantis dist n quia existentia inseparabilis est parte rei duratione contrario duratio ab existenti unaquaque utraque est aeque variabilis vel invariabilis ut si existentia sit omnino necessaria etiam duratio si illa corruptibilis vel incorruptibilis haee similiter si altera permane etiam altera si una
