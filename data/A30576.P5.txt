people extream thing much reject jeremiah prophesie captivity tell u nothing judgment hope god merciful god upon perhaps rejected surely captivity one would thought acknowledged lord belongs glory u nothing shame confusion yet heart continued hard brick fire harder fire heart time affliction shall need instance particular clear god sends ministry gospel place sometimes may rejected opening point two thing intended first come pas rejected men reject gospel secondly whats reason god send place know beforehand entertaind lord sends ministry peace offer peace jesus christ soul yet regard cast indeed first generallity people know god know deal infinite glorious god wayes know sinned therefore understand danger upon ministry gospel dry thing unto whereas soul men woman understand infinite glorious majesty deal withal thereby dreadful thing wrath god revealed soul would hearken ministry word reason appears john saith christ disciple remember word said unto servant greater lord persecuted also pesecute kept saying keep also mark ver thing unto name sake know sent here reason thus unto far entertaining rather oppose know sent say know sent know god lord father infinite

sending gospel sometimes place see prevail denies another place see among would likely prevail say strange yet certain administration god sometimes god denies gospel place doth see sent would

speech almost one scripture here chorazin bethsaida gospel sent entertain saith christ work done done tyre sydon would repented yet denied sent reason given judgment god unsearchable wayes past finding god mercy gospel send plea secondly secondly lord sends gospel though perhaps rejected generallity yet may one soul entertain among people shall much reject sake one god may send god may send minister congregation spend heart strength life may may intend one two soul unlikely others perhaps one two poor servant child worth life man may blest call home one two life time know lord let rain intendment rain water earth abundance fall upon tile stone likewise fall upon bed garden intendment say benefit ground ministry gospel god chief intent good soul though god cause ministry generally gospel preached congregation generallity doth rain upon tile stone bed good seed god intends water garden dry time aim herb yet water fall among weed lord aim herb flower though gospel dispensed others thirdly though god see none present yet god layes time come god send gospel place though see generation get good god may intend good generation come sending ministry particular generation though see entertain yet may come may entertain say china prepare work many hundred year parent preparing work child enjoy lord layes one generation child coming therefore whether entertain god notwithstanding end accomplisht fourthly another reason god sends gospel know entertaind generallity leave men wholly without excuse may put two together discover abominable sinfulness heart men leave wholly without excuse nothing world doth discover sinfulness man heart lord sends gospel among yet rejected preaching moral truth nothing much argue sinfulness man heart rejection gospel preached rejected argues abominable wickedness man heart yea ought know devil know much perversness devil hell heart man doth reject ministry gospel god never tried god never put trial offer term peace never told would reconcild upon term therefore whether perverseness heart discovered thine thou livest ministry gospel preached yet continuest wicked ungodly thou art discovered wickedness thy heart ought thou knowest beyond wickedness devil hell devil might say lord hadst thou offered term peace u would rejected doth leave men utterly without excuse say god primary intention come lord doth suffer gospel preached leave wholly without excuse text forenamed place john come spoken unto sin cloak sin sin men world sin christ coming bring sin add sin discover sin took away cloak sin upon coming shall reject offer grace bring father sin purpose sin scarlet colour plea cannot say lord thou hadst sent u reveal u thy mercy danger sin danger sin may god say send preach nothing heart blood son could pacifie sin could thing reveal evil sin excuse sin fifthly another reason one chief lord might cause hereby entertain gospel see freeness grace towards poor soul lord pleased work upon gospel hath cause attribute thing others multitude people learned men woman greater part gospel preached see thing lord hath revealed tell reason difference freegrace certainly people god pleased make gospel effectual upon hearing point seeing verified example others cause cry grace grace lord rather others proud stout vile heart see gospel rejected reason john speech juda betrayed christ lord thou

careless say done work need care take heart lament greatest affliction befal yea affliction whatsoever blessed message sent withal rejected wretched sinful men secondly god christ sometimes rejected mercy god son think much though love kindness towards others many time slighted disregarded indeed there nothing go ingenuous heart love kindness disregarded find heart troubled one done much yet deal thus lay thine hand upon thy heart consider god hath done thee christ ill thou hast requited much thee poor worm thy love kindness imbracd infinite god infinite love mercy child men imbraced rejected thirdly let learn hence never trust heart think often mean others surely better men ready trust heart use mean let u learn hence never trust heart use mean god may send mean reveal glorious truth unto yet may fall may never come partaker good thing hath many must look heart bless self god mercy lord hath sent u word plentifully gospel come opened clearly among u thats enough god hath done look heart imbrace otherwise gospel may come among yet never come saved indeed sad condition wheresoever fourthly god minister learn hence discouraged come preach expectation prevail heart people draw christ study labouring find truth gospel sit heart auditor praying come expectation good may done soul may drawn christ yet perhaps find quite otherwise people sit dead may slight contemn scorn

deep hidden mystery gospel unto thee oh admire grace god son thee bless ordinary mercy choice mercy gospel rejected many time come thou seest god hath made separation thee others told speech juda iscariot lord saith thou revealest thy self unto u unto world thou hast cause wonder indeed sixthly may hasten remains god sends gospel rejected hence scandalized see despised contemned let none scandalized saith christ mat saith poor gospel preached next word blessed whosoever offended men ready offended see great one reject ministry gospel hear god sends rejected therefore offended think others imbrace therefore nothing temptation heart many though hearing gospel preached heart taken hear convincd go away among companion others find slight disregard heart taken likewise learn point never scandalized others casting gospel christ hath forewarned minister go preach doth intimate must expect ministry must prevail lastly true god sends preaching gospel see doth prevail many let every one lay hand upon heart think thus man woman jesus christ shall preached shall prevail lord forbid though doth prevail others yet god forbid prevail heart let imbrace much rather see jesus christ rejected others go neer heart lord rejected shall rejected lord forbid christ said disciple others forsook ye also go away whither shall go thee saith peter thee word eternal life dost thou see others slight neglect glorious ministry gospel wilt thou wilt thou add dishonour gospel lord lord forbid let rather embrace much neglected disregarded others shall glorious gospel preached vain shall

let return first encouragement god minister case ministry rejected secondly dreadful denunciation shall reject gospel first encouragement minister god case ministry rejected let return two thing first

god humbled heard fell upon face god come comfort set upon foot spirit enters spake unto declared message gave roul bid eat made sweet unto though message threatning speak end shew work difficult work minister especially ministry hath success therefore point reasonable tell unto though success desire yet good ministry shall return upon people sent offer christ would fain gain soul unto christ may live ever praising rich grace god christ highest heaven know thou shait blessing peace look glory comfort shall return thy bosom ministry word duty suppose pray child friend kinsman see turned god
