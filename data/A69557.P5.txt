condition chaos particle would disunited vast interval empty space would lye form system therefore ti necessary squanderd atom convene unite great compact mass like body earth planet without coalition diffused chaos must continued reignd eternity could particle widely dispersed combine closeness texture adversary two way accounting either common motion matter proceeding external impulse conflict without attraction every body move uniformly direct line according determination impelling force may say atom chaos variously moved according catholic law must need knock interfere mean convenient figure mutual coherence might chance stick together others might join degree huge mass might formed afterwards became sun planet might arise vertiginous motion whirlpool matter chaos whereby atom might thrust crowded middle whirlpool constipate one another great solid globe appear world secondly mutual gravitation attraction may assert matter hath inherently essentially intrinseck energy whereby incessantly tends unite self matter several particle placed void space distance whatsoever would without external impulse spontaneously convene unite together thus atom chaos though never widely diffused might innate property attraction soon assemble great sphaerical mass constitute system like present heaven earth proposed atheist efficient cause world epicurean theory atom descending infinite space inherent principle gravitation tends toward matter toward vacuum nothing verging perpendicular lucret nec regione locus certa nec tempore certo body know ti miserable absurd stuff

proposition common motion without attraction disseverd particle chaos could never make world could never convene great compact mass planet either acquire continue motion planet mutual gravitation spontaneous attraction neither inherent essential matter ever supervene unless impressd infused divine power though allow attraction natural essential matter yet atom chaos could never convene form present system could form could neither acquire motion continue permanent state without power providence divine first common motion matter chaos could never convene mass planet man considers spacious

thousandth first matter mere chanceserm v p many million odds assignable experiment ti vain expect ever succeed even endless duration though concede simply possible matter chaos might convene great mass like planet yet absolutely impossible mass acquire revolution sun let u suppose one mass present earth annual revolution earth must proceed hypothesis either summ result several motion particle

really pulsion trusion belongs common motion already shewn insufficient formation world mean explaind power quality whereby parcel matter would mutually attract mutually tend press others instance two distant atom vacuo would spontaneously convene together without impulse external body say atheist suppose power inherent essential matter overthrow hypothesis could never chaos upon term present form system must continued eternity supposition proved last vide serm vi serm viii affirm might chaos notwithstanding innate gravity let assign period though never remote diffused matter might convene must confess assigned period matter existed eternally inseparably endued principle attraction yet never attracted convened infinite duration monstrous absurdity even blush charged perhaps may imagin former

material cause proceeds higher principle divine energy impression iii thirdly affirm though allow reciprocal attraction essential matter yet atom chaos could never convene form present system could form yet could neither acquire revolution subsist present condition without conservation providence divine first matter universe consequently space diffused supposed finite think might demonstrated already exceeded measure sermon since every single particle hath innate gravitation toward others proportionated matter distance evidently appears outward atom chaos would necessarily tend inwards descend quarter toward middle whole space respect every atom would lie middle greatest quantity matter vigorous attraction would form constitute one huge sphaerical mass would body universe plain therefore upon supposition matter chaos could never compose divided different mass starr planet present world allowing adversary planet might composed yet however could possibly acquire revolution circular orb one present purpose ellipsis little eccentric let assign place planet formed nearer sun present distance notoriously absurd must ascended place formation essential property mutual

nowise attaind without power divine arm case planetary motion let u conceive planet formed constituted center several orb impressd gravitating energy toward matter transverse impulse quantity projecting directly tangent orb compound motion arises gravitation projection together describes present revolution primary planet sun secondary gravity prohibiting cannot recede center motion transverse impulse withholding cannot approach although gravity could innate proved cannot yet certainly projected transverse violent motion ascribed right hand high god creator heaven earth finally though grant circular revolution could naturally attained individual world present posture motion actually formed chaos mechanical cause yet requires divine power providence conserved long present state condition shewed transverse impulse impressd upon planet retains several orb drawn gravitating power toward sun central body gravity understand constant energy faculty god hath infused matter perpetually acting certain measure naturally inviolable law say faculty power cannot conceive act gravitation present moment propagate self produce next ti otherwise transverse motion reason inactivity matter inability change present state either moving resting would one single impulse continue ever equal uniform unless changed resistence occurring body gravitating power planet since move horizontally whereby gravity doth affect swiftness liquid unresisting space heaven either body inconsiderable one occur may preserve velocity first impulse imprest upon five six thousand year many million million appears one vast sun universe rest planet revolving around concentric orb convenient distance system would long endure could naturally principle mutual attraction actually put circular motion frame present world hath quite different structure here innumerable multitude fixt starr sun demonstrated supposed also adversary mutual attraction even equal proof divine hath arbitrarily indued matter power gravity essential hath confined action matter solar system say fixt starr principle mutual gravitation yet neither revolved common center transverse impulse thing else restrain approaching toward gravitating power incite natural cause overcome nature self hold keep fixed station interval incessant inherent tendency desert nothing could hinder outward starr system planet must necessarily descended toward middlemost system universe whither would strongly attracted part finite space evident therefore present frame sun fixt starr could possibly subsist without providence almighty deity spake word made psal commanded created hath made fast ever ever hath given law shall broken secondly supposition infinite chaos ti hard indeed determin would follow imaginary case innate principle gravity hasten conclusion grant present diffused matter might convene infinite number great mass great distance one another like starr planet visible part world impossible planet naturally attain circular revolution either intrinsec gravitation impulse ambient body plain difference whether world infinite finite argument used may equally urged supposition though concede revolution might acquired settled constituted present state posture thing yet say continuance frame order long duration known age world must necessarily infer existence god though universe infinite fixt starr could fixed would naturally convene together confound system system mutually attracting every one would move whither powerfully drawn may say indubitable case finite world system must need outmost therefore drawn toward middle infinite system succeed one another infinite space none either inward outward may system situated accurate poise equally attracted side remain fixed unmoved reply unless mathematical center gravity every system placed fixed mathematical center attractive power rest cannot evenly attracted side must preponderate way considers mathematical center quantity infinitly divisible never persuaded universal equilibrium arising coincidence infinite center naturally acquired maintaind say upon supposition infinite matter every system would infinitly therefore equally attracted side consequently would rest exact equilibrium center gravity position soever overthrow hypothesis rate infinite chaos nothing could formed particle could convene mutual attraction every one must infinite matter around therefore must rest ever evenly balanced infinite attraction even planet upon principle must gravitate toward sun way would revolve curve line fly away direct tangent till struck planet starr remote region infinite space equal attraction side matter equal attraction mean motion universe must proceed external impulse alone proved incompetent cause formation
