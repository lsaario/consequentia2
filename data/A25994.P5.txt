power bank bill issued make valuable money accepting higher rate gainer thereby profit bank depends upon credit billsproved credit bill depends upon making valuable money making bill valuable money depends accepting higher rate money money bill never keep long par bill better money theyll soon worse money get upper hand credit put end credit day credit kingdom credit men choose bill rather money take cant receive money present credit kingdom credit man cant pay debt therefore give bond creditor forced accept want money bank england issued bill cannot pay people bill must keep fresh money brought bank bill without credit maintaind finding great demand upon immediately raised interest upon bill hoping thereby keep bill demanded draw fresh monies proved ineffectual bill interest value bill without interest shews plainly giving interest bill doth add credit bank raising interest bill bank raise interest monies bank keep monies bank raise interest overtake money faster money go raising interest l per cent upon bill payable demand raise l per cent common security therefore bank always fall interest fast others endeavour raise credit begged bought forced giving interest bill begging credit buying money may done common way mortgaging without keeping monies pay principal demand policy bank england got coin raised clipt full money raised value bill accepting reciepts interest crown others money kept price money bill got let money weight receipt accept bill higher rate doth depreciate money keep bill therefore case landbank established parliament proposed ti intended interest l per cent shall reduced l per cent pay landbank bill advance credit bank consequently profit enabling lend great quantity bank like merchant whose gain dont arise extravagant profit particular commodity greatness trade retailer get per cent merchant therefore power bank whence bill issued make valuable money accepting money gainer thereby tenth assertion invention falling

value money sold thereby depreciated certain falling interest money doth depreciate value purchase soil land doth depreciate purchase commodity severed soil interest money annual profit therefore doth affect nothing hath annual increase soil land annual interest owner therefore price thereof rise fall interest money annual commodity severed soil lye principal therefore interest money annual doth
