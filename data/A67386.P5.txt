eighth letter concerning sacred trinity occasioned letter subject john wallis c since publishing seven letter three sermon concerning sacred trinity received occasion several letter diver person known unknown concerning subject mostly way gratulation approbation done expression therein mine much purpose contrary undertook maintain one unknown person subscribed b written seems countrey gentleman professed divine though pretend much versed schooldivinity yet find stranger left bookseller intimation author willing printed left bookseller purpose though hath delayed hitherto author desire followeth letter reverend doctor wallis occasioned several letter touching doctrine trinity c reverend sir ti gratitude acknowledgement directs line fortunate meet several letter affirmance doctrine blessed trinity c cannot confess self confirmed much enlarged notion doctrine plain pressing reason discourse lest seem fond understanding fancy self comprehend touching matter indeed shall humbly offer method thought submit grave judgment allowance metaphysicians remember teach u one way know deity way eminency good perfection creature say god great author cause thing must eminent high degree attribute god competent man made image measure god highest superlative degree besides eminence perfection deity three particular transcendent eminence wherein whereby god hath manifested good mankind god almighty pleased infinite mercy determine mankind rescued state sin defection first father brought u brought back state salvation bring effect great work reach humane contemplation otherwise known god hath pleased reveal discover u scripture scripture intimate u three several manifestation deity great work salvation first father god father heaven earth created world power preserveth providence loved world sent begotten son saviour mighty redeemer second son jesus christ begotten son god undertook great work man redemption purpose came world became man second adam holy life absolute perfect obedience god expiate make atonement disobedience first third holy ghost inward operation gracious influence doth incline prevail man embrace redemption purchased upon term gospel respect three several manifestation deity said trinity person vnity godhead god respect one manifestation called god father respect another called god son respect third called god holy ghost three eminent manifestation deity denomination father son holy ghost plain scripture great doubt whether three personality deity doubt take ariseth misunderstanding mistaking true sense word persona word persona think philosopher short definition boethius defines naturae rationalis individua substantia philosopher dislike scanty applicable man doth include spiritual being therefore inlarge make comprehensive call substantia particularis intelligens incommunicabilis c part cannot like boethius definition best think far right make word persona applicable man doubtless true proper signification applicable spirit metalepsis transumption word herein philosopher short definition persona done much upon word substance forget accident necessary ingredient true definition word persona relation man doth signifie individuality denote particular single man doth imply quality also whereby one man differeth another word quality mean single predicament called predicament except substanee whereby naturae rationalis substantia individuated ti quantity differs person taller stature lower ti quality differs learned vnlearned person ti relation differs father son ti ubi locality differs john noke john style predicament would therefore propose adding word boethius definition think well enough let thus viz persona est naturae rationalis individua substantia taliter qualiter ab aliis differens thus defined relates man one man differeth another accidental individuation thought true every person single substance yet ti true accident determine personality specifick difference constitute specie predicamental accident constitute individual thus rationality doth constitute specie man differs brute thus wisdom fortitude c differ particular man another make person another certain notion naked substance otherwise conceive clothed variegated accident purpose also true sense meaning greek word 〈 nonlatin alphabet 〉 strictly translated latine subsistentia subsistentia doth import esse substance modus essendi doth modifie substance quality accident fundamental mistake therefore great point hath making word substance necessary definition persona concluding thence cannot three person must three several substance whereas truth may one particular man diversly qualified circumstanticated diverse personality thus man melchisedeck melchisedeck king salem may said one person melchisedeck priest high god another david respect double qualification king prophet thus much conceive true notion persona consider word persona hath applyed godhead must say said word persona used borrowed sence want another word might appositely fully signifie intended god cannot properly said person accident attribute essential wisdom finite man accidental infinite god essential attribute perfection deity imperfect low degree competent man borrowed sence therefore word persona applyed deity respect three eminent manifestation deity said three person word person distinction personality respect men doth bear full analogy difference personality deity contemplation god must expect fall short comprehend consideration different personality amongst men may help u imperfect measure conceive trinity adore vnity godhead object expect objection respect three manifestation deity said three person said person godhead three even many divine attribute many manifestation deity u answ much reason imagine personality godhead three three although true every attribute doth import deity predicated nothing else deity yet every single attribute doth may speak import whole deity infinite wisdom doth necessarily import administer u notion infinite power attribute three several manifestation godhead called three person wherein whole deity may say doth exert self appear attribute therefore call three transcendent eminence manifestation deity thus conceive trinity person godhead sort intelligible without necessity thinking three person must three several substance consequently three god must confess cannot think great dispute meer wrangling business contest word thing time adversary fearful multiplying deity dividing substance tell believe one god three person godhead one god dispute whether say three person deity doth necessarity imply three substance declare mean intend part fairly declare believe three several manifestation deity viz god father god son god holy ghost held forth u scripture would willingly compound word person comply use word shall find may better well express mean come great objection adversary touching hypostatical vnion divine humane nature could united person person time god man without multiplying dividing deity without confining omnipresent scanty tenement humane body godman born virgin overshadowing holy ghost humane nature propagated without natural help man thing seem utterly impossible men great reason therefore must cannot scripture must rather mistaken false true think cannot bvt argue thus impossibility wonder curiosity doth question creation self possible god make thing nothing hypostatical vnion methinks question strictly ought give better account yet given vnion soul man body question born virgin may well question first woman made rib man one well supposed come pas divine power bvt apt suspect far scripture authority amongst reasoning men adventure propose one consideration touching hypostatical vnion shew inconceivable thing humane reason would let consider several degree being god hath made world tree plant hath given vegetation brute besides vegetation hath given animal life sens appetite discern endeavour necessary preservation being step consider man besides god hath given rational mind soul step yet let consider higher being angel pure intellectual being degree perfection god hath given beyond hath given man say consider necessity limiting confining god almighty may reasonably think infinite wisdom thought fit might well make yet perfect conceiveable bring eternal purpose might actuate humane nature divine power make man even perfection deity reside principle essentiality vitality whit divided deity giving life creature eternal mind whit multiplied divided giving rational soul mind man infinite eternal spirit world multiplied divided creating giving glorious spirit angel necessity think godhead must either multiplied divided wise varied acting divinity humane nature oh rebellious mankind hast offended thy creator ungrateful wilt accept mercy upon term believe exhibited manner revealed god whose justice infinite offended god also infinite goodness mercy appeased room
