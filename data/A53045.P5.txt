animal restoringbed may restore dead animal former animal life case animal root seed name vital part divided dispersed inclosed inurned animal could come feed root seed dead animal body case body

major part time degree restoration human creature minor opinion restoring action nature much quicker producing action human creature might restored month time whereas production human creature ten month though human creature may quicken three month time yet fully ripe birth time ten month major part opinion restoration according creature dissolved man newly dead long dead part yet divided man might restored life hour time le part excepting bare carcase dissolved would require long time restoring producing minor opinion restoringtime longer time quickning major part opinion though exterior

comparison ripe fruit last part mind agree human creature dissolved excepting bare carcase would require ten month time ere could perfectly restored springing part would require long time ere could

nature required restoringbeds yet agreed like flesh softness spunginess also colour also agreed animal restoringbed nature property could dilate contract occasion much could contract compass smallest
