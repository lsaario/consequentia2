l cap et primo videamus ubi baptismus evangelio stabilitur nam lege mat ult quomodo christus mandavit suis apostolis ite docete c et hinc philippus baptizans eunuchum act prius instruxit eum fideet propter hanc formam verborum christi mat ult ecclesia nostra adducit fideles pro infante qui discretionem non attigerat respondentes et tale compatres communiter faciunt quod filii sui quos de baptismo elevant sint oratione dominica et symbolo instructi et alii qui discretionem attigerant dum instruuntur fide christi ante suum baptismum vocantur catechumeni hoc autem sacramentum est tam necessarium viatori quod christus dicit nicodemo joh nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua c ex tanta itaque authoritate fidei scripturae sunt fideles generaliter baptizati et ordinavit ecclesia quod quaelibet persona fidelis necessitatis articulo poterit baptizari nec refert sive immergantur semel vel ter sive aqua super caput sua effundantur sed faciendum est secundum consuetudinem locus quem quis incolit tam uno ritu legitimo quam alio quia certum est quod corporalis baptizatio sive lotio modicum valet nisi adsit lotio mentis per spiritum sanctum peccato originali vel actuali hoc est enim principium hac fide quod quicunque rite baptizatus fuerit baptismus delet quodcunque peccatum invenerit homine baptizando et quia ad delationem peccati requiritur satisfactio et non potest fieri satisfactio pro peccato nisi per mortem christi ideo dicit apostolus rom quicunque baptizati sumus christo jesu morte ejus baptizati sumus alith sed dic rogo clarius quomodo christus qui tantum odivit signa sensibilia tantam necessitatem salvationis posuit hujusmodi lotione videtur enim derogare divinae liberalitati atque potentiae quod deus non posset intercedere toto merito suo atque passione salvare infantem vel adultum fidelem nisi vetula vel alio viante baptizetur communiter infideli similiter delato infante fidelium ad ecclesiam ut secundum christi regulam baptizetur et deficiente aqua vel requisitis aliis stante pia intentione totius populi interim mortuo naturaliter nutu dei videtur grave damnationem infantis hujusmodi definire specialiter cum nec infans iste nec populus peccavit ut taliter damnaretur vbi est ergo misericors liberalitas christi dei si talis prole fidelium propter illud quod non est potestate eorum damnabitur cum deus secundum principia theologiae communia sit pronior ad praemiandum homines quam ad dammandum et specialiter merito et passione christi tantum sua tentoria dilatante thus englished first let u see baptism stablished gospel read mat christ

proceedeth answer rest videtur mihi probabile quod christus satis posset sine lotione hujus infantes spiritualiter baptizare et per consequens salvare unde dicitur communiter quod triplex est baptismus ecclesiae viz baptismus fluminis baptismus sanguinis baptismus flaminis et quilibet eorum comparibus sufficit ad salutemnec audeo asserere quod infantes occisi pro christo sint damnati baptismus autem flaminis est bapt sp sancti qui est simpliciter necessarius cuilibet homini si salvetur ideo duo baptismi priores sunt signa antecedentia et ex suppositione necessaria ad istum tertium baptismum flaminis ideo absque dubietate si iste insensibilis baptismus ad fuerit baptizatus est crimine mundatus et si iste defuerit quantumcunque adsint priores baptismus non prodest animae ad salutem ideo cum recte sit insensibilis tantum nobis ignotus videtur mihi imprudens praesumptio taliter salvationem hominis vel damnationem ex baptismo definire reputamus tamen absque dubietate quod infantes recte baptizati flumine sint baptizati tertio baptismate cum habent gratiam baptismalem non enim licet fidelibus supponendo baptismum flaminis baptismum fluminis omnino relinquere sed necesse est data opportunitate circumstantiae ipsum accipere et cum omnia quae eveniunt de necessitate eveniunt dici potest quod talis homo non potest salvari sine talus baptismate thus englished seemeth
