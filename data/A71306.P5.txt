esto entendio ser gente que trata verdad quando sali desta isla de taumaco hize oger quatro muy gallardos indios los tres se becharon nado el que quedo despnes se pedro declaro en el puerto de acapidco por el camino enla ciudad de mexico adonde murio endola visto el marque de monte claro lo siguiente sin nunca variar annque se le pre gunto en diuersos tiempos por muchas persona de muchos modos se le negauan contradezian sus dichos lo primero dixo pedro ser natural de vna isla que se llama chicayana mayor que la de taumaco adonde de hallamos que de la vna ala otra ay quatro dia de camino de sus embarcaciones que chicayana e tierra rasa muy abundante de los frutos referidos que la gente della e de su bue na color chicayana isla de indio cabello suelto largo que se labran como el lo estaua poco enel rostr ombros pechos que tambien ay hombre blancos que tienen los cabellos rubios muy largo que ay mulatos cuyo cabello e frisado ni de todo suelto que el era texedor soldado flechero que en su lengua se llamaua luca su muger layna su lio ley dixo ma que en aquella su isla ay muchas ostras como de la que visus concha traxe algunas que aqui tengo de tres tamarinos el primero e el comun de la margarita el segundo mayor al doble el tercero de palmo menos de diam tro que toda estas ostras llaman totofe que en ellas se hallan perlas la quales llaman futiquilquil por esto le mostre la concha el la tomo en la manos en ellas fue mostrando la partes se crian preguntado quantas eran de que tamanno dixo que en vnas se hallan ma en otras menos para dar entender el grandor dezia que la ay como arena como sal como pedrezitas como cuentas de rosario como botones como tenia en vn coleto otras mayores que se pescan en menos de medio estado de fondo de piedras arena que son muy gran de los trechos de mar que alli tienen poco fondo que el mismo sin cabullir se la sacaua con la mano la ponia en su canoa que solo la quieren para comer su carne la qual llaman canofe que la concha le sir en para hazer anzuelos cucharas otras cosas que la perlas le siruende nada dixo ma que ay en osta misma isla de chicayana ra suerte de ostras la qual llaman taquila para dar entender su tamanno sennalo el grandor de vna buena rodela por hazerseme increyble la mucha camidad que dixo de toda perlas la grandeza destas taquilas le pregunte si nacian dentro en los coco en los arboles en la pennas en la tierra por fuera de la concha dixo que se hallan sino en le suelo del mar dentro en ellas la perlas que la ostras la vnas estan recostadas todos lados otras enh estas abiertas hazia arriba que si en algunas destas ostras entran la mano que se ci rra luego go dixo ay mano que esta causa la sacan con palos con lazadas de cuerdas que tienen grande muy buena carne que ellos comen hazen caso de la perlas que la vezes que la queria el mismo la pescana la llenaua su casa como el orro viage yo mismo vi made two voyage la indios de la isla de santacruz traer del cuello colgadas muchas patenas mayores menores toda de concha de nacar entendi ser loque pedro de zia lo mismo de la patenas esta causa hazia mucha cuenta deste dicho ma viendo que vnas vezes se enoiaua otras con muy grande ahinco trabaiaua por darse entender por esto le mostre vn guijarro negro redon del tamanno de vna ciruela temprana le pregunte si en su tierra auia per la assi como aquella dixo que porque aquel guijarro era negro la perlas blancas como papel que quando la miraua al sol que la vislumhre dellas le dana en los oios assi hazia con ellos como si la tnuiera presentes preguntado si la auia tan grandes como el referido guijarro dix que otras auia chiquitas como el guijarro luego tunto la cabeca del dedo pulgar con la del indice en forma de circulo alli con vn dedo de la otra mano fue senna lando may ore menores perlas que en cada hostia ay ma de vna sola con todo temiendo ser lo que dezia la patenas de mi sospecha le pregun te si eran chatas redonda de otras formas nome entendio por este len guage luego hize como que queria poner el guij arro en el suelo son de correr assi como lo vio dixo con gran demostracion que quando la echa nan en el suelo ynan rodando por manera que mi entender dio claramen ta ser perlas redonda de los tamannos referidos que su hijo trahia al cuello vna dellas que el mismo la horado con piedra blanca delgada que el fondo de adonde la sacana e de do estados ma menos que en sus concha dan de comer los puertos preguntele si la grandes concha tienen el mismo lustre que tienen la ordinarias que le mostre dixo que si toda estas otras preguntas le hize muy trocadas como en su tierra se llaman los arcabuzes otras de nuestras cosas dixo que la ay por manera que siempre respondio sin sospechas solo dio nombre con mucha resolucion la cosas que ellos tienen yo afirmo por verdad que entendi escriuir la grandeza ni el mucho numero que dixo auer de toda suerte de perlas por parecerme noticia nunca oyda ma considerando que naturaleza e po derosa para criar como ya se han visto grandes perlas de la comunes tan gran suma en el rio de la hacha margarita cubagua yo porfie tanto en inquirir esta su declaracion pareciome deuer dezir lo que este indio dixo tantas vezes otras muchas persona que con menos cuy dado le examinaron en suma yo hago la diligencias escriuo como hombre que tengo de morir se quando dixo ma que de la isla de taumaco tres dirs de camino de chicayana ad o ay otra isla mayor que guatopo isla la do dichas que se llama guaytopo poblada de gente tan blanca como loes en comun la nuestra que hasta los hombre tienen rubios los abellos ma menos tambien negro que se labran la barrigas su nibel todo en rueda que toda tres islas son gente amiga de vna lengua que vsan darse la p en los carrillos que tienen por sennal de enemigos quando huyen los rostros que en esta isla ay muchos ostrales de los tres generos menores en grandes trechos de mar de fondo assi coma el de chica yana que tienen much perlas preguntado si el auia estado en ella dixo que luego le bolui preguntar como sa bia lo dicho lo conio desta manera que de aquella isla salio vn nauio gran de los suyos con ma de cincuenta persona buscar concha de carey de que vsan hazer carcillos otros iuguetes que cuelgan de la oreias otra isla poblada que llaman mecaraylay que estando vist della e dio mecaraylay vn viento contrario que le obligo buscar su isla de la qual estendo cerca boluio el viento ser contrario que andando en estas bueltas se le acabo el bastimento cuya falta murieron quarenta persona de hambre sed que el estaua en la isla de taumaco quando este nauio aporto alli con solo siete hombre muy blancos excepto eluno que era moreno con tres mugeres blancas hermosas como espannolas que tenian los cabellos rubios muy largo que toda tres venian cubiertas de cabe ca hasta los pie con vuos como mantos azules negro muy delgados que llaman foafoa que de toda estas diez persona solo quedo viuo el indio olan al qual los uuestros quando alli lo viero en taumaco tan blanco tan bermeio le llama ron el flamenco como q eda referido que este indio olan otros le contaron quanto ha dicho de aquella isla de guay tupo g e el mismo vio nir su isla de chicayana otro nauio de aquellos de do vasos cargado de gente blanca hermosa con muchas muy lindas muchachas dio entender contando por los dedos de diez en diez ser por todos ciento diez persona dixo ma que de otra isla que se llama tucopio que e donde los do indios se echaron nado como queda referido cinco dia de su nauegar ay aquella gran tierra manicolo poblada de mucha gente lora tucopio isla manicolo terr grande mulata en grandes pueblo para dar entender su tamanno sennalo el de acapulco otros mayores por esto le pregunte si auia pueblo tan grandes como mexico dixo que ma que muchas gens que son sus amigo comen carne humana ni se entienden la lenguas que e tierra de muy altas serra nias grandes rio que algunos dellos se pueden vadear sino passarse en canoas pue para ir de la isla tucopia aquella tierra quando sale el sol le queda la mano izquierda que viene ser del sur para el sudeste digo pues que si esto e assi como lo dixo que viene bien con la cordillera de sierra que se vieron ir corriendo la buelta del poniente como esta dicho en su lugar quando fuimos desgarrando mucho encarecio pedro la grandeza po placion fertilidad otras cosas desta tierra que el otros indios fueron ella en vna de sus embarcaciones buscar vn tron de vn grande arbol de los muchos que ay en ella para hazer vna piragua que vio alli vn puer dio entender ser mayor de boca ma cerrada que lo e el de la bahia de san felipe santiago que el miro su fondo ser de arena su play del astre como el otro ya dicho que tiene dentro quatro rio mucha gente que por la costa de aquella tierra anduuieron hazia el poniente ma camino que ay de acapulco mexico sin verle fin se buluieron su isla aduierto que como yo auia visto aquella isla de tucopia dixe adrede que sabia auer en ella muchas ostras perlas que dixo que ay sino mucho fondo que e assi verdad porque lo hize sondar dixo ma que de taumaco atres dia de camino con viento fresco do ay otra isla que se llama fonoso partida en muchas islas pequennas rasas por esto cautela le dixe que auia en ellas grandes rio pues grandes rio en islas pequennas rasas los puede auer dixo que sino pocos que ono fono isla son toda muy fertiles muy pobladas de gens loras indios mulatos muy alto en demasia tanto que con ser algo ma alto que yo sennalo en vna pared todo quanto pudo alcancar con los dedos estendidos braco dixo ser aquella su altura que son sus amigo ma de su lengua que en estas islas ay grandes trechos de mar de poco de mucho fondo commanchas de muchas hostras que el mismo la saco para comer la que te nian perlas de los tamannos que tiene dicho excepto la taquilas que ay alli vn muy buen puerto tambien dixo que cerca destas islas ay otra que se dize pilen otra nupan que tienen lo mismo de comidas gens perlas de oydas de vista dio nombre otras muchas pilen isla pupan isla islas de toda dixo lo dicho aduiertese que en toda la india en solo la margarita en el ri de la hacbo se ha sacado va sacando la multitud de la perlas que se sabe de xo la pocas v tan buenas de panama digo que si e assi como est dicho que much o numeros se pueden esperar de adonde dio la noticia assi por ser much estas partes como por la grandeza de los mare que dixo tienen poco fondo ma se aduierte que solo dixo de la ostras que alcancan ver los oios solo con la manos cogen sin zabu rse quedando siempre reseruadas la do quatro ocho ma bracas como oy se pescan en sa margarita en mexico lleue pedro por do vezes casa de vn h r adador de perlas mi ruego le mostro de todos los generos comunes assi como los vio se alegro mucho dixo con gran demostration encarccimiento que en su tierra ay muchas perlas ma blanchas que aquellas mostrole ma vnos barruecos assientos grandes abromados hizo mal gesto dixoque aquello era buono que en su tierra auia meior ma diligencia hizo el alcalde mayor del puerto de acapulco pedro flores pues le mostro vna cadena de muchas sartas de perlas le pregunto si en su tierra auia de aquellas cadenas dixo que luego saco de alli ciertas perlas se la mostro en la mano le pregunto si auia assi como aquello dixo que si ma que estauan hor adadas se puede presumir que falta de broca de taladros se aprouechan de la perlas de la concha si por ser mayores del mismo lustre faciles de horadar dixo ma que en taumaco ay vn indio grau piloto que sabe los nombres de muchas tierras en la quales ha estado muchas vezes que de vna grantierra que se llama pouro muy poblada cu gente pouro gran tierra lora e indios algunos son amigo su yos otros muy belieosos guerrer o entresi traxo su isla de taumaco vn pagagayo de pecho cuello colorado ciertas flechas con puntas forma de cuchillo que el mismo la vto la tento dio entender que le querian para con ellas matar ma facilmente por esto le mostre vn cuchillo dixo ser negro al respeto de la puntas mostrele vn vaso de plata dixo ser la puntas tan blancas como ella muchas vezes le contradixe este dicho siempre ma se afirmo admierto que en la bahiya de san felipe santiago se hallaron en vna casa muchas piedras negras pesadas que caso traaeron do partes tan grandes cada vna dellas como vna nuez que en la ciudad de mexico vn francisco pachoco duenno de mina vn diego gomez de molina la vieron en mi mi posada el vno dellos mostraron lleno de oios de plata por esto lo lleuamos luego casa de vn ensayador que lo puso en vn crisol ella por sus razones le dio tanto fuego que el crisol se desfondo assino se vio na da toda via yo auia quedado con la otra parte que el ensayador requemo en esta se vio vna puntilla que estendida al martillo se toco luego en tres piedras dixeron seis plateros ser toque de plata para ma certificarse tocaron plomo estanno otra plata concscida iunto ella ma huuo alli quien dixo que aquel ensaye se auia de hazer por azogue otros que con salitron ciertas cosas el ensayador afirmo ser bueno el metal aqui se toco la puntilla dixeron do plateros que e plata estas piedras auia mostrado pedro assi como la vio dixo que en los cerros de taumaco muchas dellas que se llama treaque que tanbien la ay en aquillo gran tierra manicolo que todos los indios la quieren los vnos para labrarse otros para inuiexarse con ellas ylo mismo dixo paulo de su tierra que e la bahia de san felipe santiago de adonde se traxeron dizen mineros que adonde ay inuixes ay metales que por los inuixes se descubreron la mina de plata oro de luis de la nueua espanna la de azogue de guancauelica del piru aduierto que dezir pedro que vio flechas con puntas de plata parece que por razon de la poca que se hallo en aquel poco metal que tan caso setra por la dispusicion de la tierra el sitio ser paralelo delp ru obligan creer que puede ser assi como lo dixo aduierta se ma que pedron despues que supo darse entender en uuestra lengua confor con todolo que dixeron los indios de taumaco esto assi en la tierra grande como en la muchas islas muchas gens algunas cor pulentas labradas por labrar varios coleres largo cabellos rubios negro srisa do crespos de que estan pobladas iuntamente en la mucha abundancia de comidas de vnos mismos generos que todos tienem tambien se aduierta que lo referido lo auemos visto desta vez que lanti erra donde estuuimos surtos parece ser la misma que va prosiguiendo de la grandeza que ellos dizen suma digo fundado en razones fuertes que aquellas gens estan alli por vezindad continuacionen otras tierras ma al sur leste oeste que si ay milagro que en aquella oculta quarta de globo estey muy grandes muy estendidas prouincias llenastodas de muchas muy varia gens que en todos generos aura ventaia quanto ma fueren subiendo de quinze grados arriba por venderse tan caro se deu esperar meior en todo lo apuntado grados first voyage aduiertase que la primera vez que el adelantado aluaro de mendasia fue scubrio la que llamo de salomon hallo en ellas se traxeron cantidad de perlas stadas al fuego porque los solo comen la carne assando la ostras que el segundo viage que hizo el mismo adelantado descubrio second voyage isl de santa cruz de nueuo la isla de santacruz donde murio que en ella yo mismo vi muchas concha aquellas muchas patenas de nacar referidas que de vna cierta isla alli cerca se traxo vn muchacho que se llamo miguelillo que este despues que supo nuestra lengua dio noticia de auer en su tierra muchas perlas congrandes muestras de ser assi tambien se aduierta que desta ida auemos visto en tres islas la concha de nacar de los tres tamannos en la vna dellas ostiones secos adonde se hallaron algunas perlas menudas pormanera que iuntando lo que dixo pedro lo que se ha visto son quinze la islas de que ay noticia que tienen perlas por la vista de sus concha se pueden deuen esperar tambien por ser aquella poca altura tan propriaparacriarse quanto aquellas grandes taquillas lo dexo al tiempo solo aduierto que pues pedro dixo que ay grandes perlas que tambien dixo auer grandes concha capazes dellas en suma digo que dios nuestro sennor da de vna vez todo quanto puedo que primero haze la prueua del costoso sufrido amor que le tienen la persona quien encamina vna tan gran cosa como u en esta dixo ma pedro que al diablo llaman terua que habla con los indios de vn palo sin ser visto que el mismo todos ellos de noche muchas vezes le palpaua los rostros los pechos con cosa muy fria que quertendo saber lo que era hallauan nada esto dezia mostrando cierto recato temor dan bien entender se cosa mala para ellos bien aborrecible tanbien dixo otros que mi que ante que su tierra fueramos ya el diablo le auia dic ho que los auiamos de ir matar mostraua muchos desseos de boluer su tierra para dezir al sennor de taumaco todo el bien que le auiamos hecho que los otros indios sus companneros ellos mismos se hecharon de la naos nado que nosotros le hizimos ningun mal tambien ma para dezir todos sus naturales quan buena cosa e ser christiano que el despues que lo era el diablo le hablo ni le ni de noche le palpo para traer su hijo venirse viuir con nosotros tamcien dixo que ensu isla de chicayana ay perros grandes como los nuestros que los llaman ticuri que ay muchas auas como la de europa ma que la sabien comer vna fruta quiso dezir mancanas porque la vio mucho gengibre que en su tiempo haze buen frio con ser en tan poca altura ma dixo que los que matan honbres los ahorean que nuestros cauallos son buenos para andar en ellos ma para ser seruido de los honbres era pedro al parecer de edad de venticinco annos en aquella sazon que declaro sabia poco de la lengua castellana esta causa costo mucho trabaio esta su declaracion porque se le ha negado repeti muchas e parece que si viuiera dier ma razon que ha dado ma yo creo que e ma paracreer lo que esta dicho que lo fuera si llegara ser se ladino con que yo todos quanto le trataro le teniamos por hombre de verdad de verguenca vn dia entro en la glesia de san francisco de mexico por ver en ella muchos crucifixos dixo que como auia alli tantos dioses si le dezian que auia ma que vn solo dios fuele respondido ser todos retratos del verdadeao christo con esto con lo demas que se le dixo parecio satisfacerse los frayles que le oyeron se alegraron por ser pregunta de hombre que sabia discurrir finalmente domingo de ramos murio yo fio de la misericordia de dios que pues por vn en estranno modo le traxo al bautismo morir confessado olea le en tan sennalado di con muestas de buen christiano que ha sido para darle su santa gloria este fue su dichoso fin del qual deuo estar muy consolado parece que su diuina magestad va ordenando que casi ay medios humanos para acabar aquella su tan grande obra almenos que falten aquellos en que ma estriuo puedo estriuar el otro indio se llamaua paulo era muchacho de hasta ocho annos de color loro cabello frisado tenia muy hermosos oios muy buen talle meior condicion tanto que todos quantos le trataron le querian mucho por se tan docil agradable sabia como pedro la quatro oraciones se per signaua con mucha alegria bautizado buen christiano le lleuo dios el dia dela ascension daua razon del demonio que llamaua hadanua de como habla con los indios sin ser visto tanbien la daua de perros mayores menores de vn animal como gato de vn granderio hazia la parte de supueblo que en aquella su tierra ay mucha gente guerrera enemiga vnade otra queno se come carne humana esto se deue creer porla mucha que tienen de puercos gallina tantas otras comidas pues el comer se carne humana entre otras gens par ce proceder de la ester elidad de la tierras de la vestialidad desus moradores porque era ninno estaua enforma se pudo saber del quanto se quiso vn pe quenno vocabulario tengo que e lo que pude iuntar de la lenguas de pedro paulo lo que dezir que e muy pronunciable por todo lo dicho se vee claramente que solo ha auidodos grandes partes de tierras partadas desta europa de la africa asia la primera e la america que descubrio christoual colon la segunda postrer del mundo e la que vi pretendo poblar acabar de descubrir para u esta grandeza deue de ser abracada assi por tener tanto de dios como por ser dar principio vna tan grande obra de tantos tan grandes bienes que ninguna otra de su genero puede ser ma ni tanto al presente ni adelante como lo podre mostrar si soy oydo preguntado si ndo pues este caso tan admirable quanto sueua viendo tan empennada mi conciencia serme fuercas tan grandes tan pessadas cargas que por abreuiar prometo u de pudiere llegar con ellas tuniere de licencia aora para ma obligar v lo que tan obligado le tierie el titulo de rey catolico defensor de la fe uerdo quan real sennalada merced de dios e esta negada todos los reyes dei mundo solo v concedida cuyo sonido retin e fuerca causar grandes inuidias su pessar de toda ellas v ha de conseguir el ma principal intento que e solo hazer la guerra al infierno que tanto estrago haze en vn numero tan copi de almas redimidas por la persona de christo con la esperanea que queda de quantas se han de saluar andando tiempos siendo la saluacion de vna sola de tanto precio quae si necessario fuera el mismo christo viniera dar la vida por ella con esto queda sennor bien entendido de quanto valor e este hecho quantos premios dara dios por auerlo contanto amor feruor intentado quantos ma grados de gloria tendra v si da fin esta obra de tanta piedad misericordia tan digna de recebir en la memoria de la gens aduirtiendo que serum con tanto gasto de nero ni de hombre ni con aquellos estragos ruynas escandalos que suele auer para auerigar el derecho de muy pequennos estados sino poner debaxo de la proteccion real con medios todos muy suaues iustificados quanto los puedo mostrar vna tan gran parte de toda la tierra poblada para en ella sembrar bienes costellos frutos que yo espero en dios han de ser muchos muy dulces muy rico muy duraderos solo quiero por paga de tanto quanto tanto vale que v crea la mportancia del caso quanto conuiene loque pido que en todo trato verdad que e
