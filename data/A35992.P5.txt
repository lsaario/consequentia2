serenissima regina suasu consili su rum consiliariorum proposuit colloqui de tribus articulis cum illustriss atoribus christianissimi regis ad primum de coronat ducis serenissima regina non potest sine assensu trium ordinum seu statuum regnisui concedere ut serenissimus dux post nuptias celebratas coronetur ut rex verem ut habiatur coronetur ut rex respectu matrimonii cum regina sine aliquo prejudicio juris tituli suae majestatis aut hered aut success ejus si id fieri potest communi consilio consensu eorum statuum majestas sua libenter assensura est dabit operam ut serenissimi ducis honor amplitudo eo modo augeatur eo libentius quia per accessionem aliquam ad ejus amplitudinem majestatis suae splendor gloria etiam incrementum capiet ad secundum de conju ctione administratione regnorum secundo existimat sua majestas ut concedatur sereniss mo duci ut ipse sereniss dux una cum serenissima regina consorte sua constante matrimonio stilo honore nomine regio censeatur gaudeat eandemque serenissima reginam consortem suam foelici regnorum dominiorum administratione gubernatione adjuvet tanquam maritus salvis tamen juribus legibus consuetudinibus regni ut tert articulo prioris scripti intitulati explanatio articulorum c continetur ad tertium de toleranda religione ducis tertio ubi ab oratore postulatum est quemadmodum rege christianissimo mandatis se habuisse asseruit ut scripto authentico valido facultas concederet dicto serenissimo duci domesticis ejus excercendum suae religionis anglia quod cum propter multas graf causa majestate reginae fieri non posse responsum esset agitatum postea inter dictos oratores consiliarios dicte reginae ut saltem privato aliquo singrapho reginae serenissimae serenissimus dux certior redderetur futurum esse ut nullo modo impedritur hoc regno religionem suam excercere quod cum ad maiestatem reginae relatum esset ita consiliariis suis responsum dari v sum est imprimis quod existimatur serenissimum ducem non futurum alienum religione ecclesiae anglicanae si de ea bene candide rec e informaretur maxime expedire etiam videbatur si de hac causa exercendae religionis nihil ageretur aliquo tractatu aut colloquio sed quae ea apparebant difficultates controversie mutuo utriusque principis colloquio componerentur sed cum id oratoribus nullo modo placere videatur non absurdum esse putabatur si hoc modo utriusque menti conscienti consulatur si serenissimus dux temporibus usitatis divinorum officioru una cum serenissim regina oratoriis suis adesse volet neque religionis anglicanae institutiones rationes audire ediscere temporibus congruis recusabit eadem serems ima regina assentietur ut neque ipsemet dux neque sui domestici contra conscientiam suam aut illorum cogantur ritibus aut ceremoniis ecclesiae anglicanae eo modo uti quo subditi regni ex legibus obliga tur donec instituti alit r persuasi fuerint porro idem serenissimus dux numerus domesticorum suorum de quo postea convenietur non molestabuntur per leges hujus regni propter usurpationem aliorum divinorum rituum ceremoniarum ecclesiarum ecclesiae dei non aperte repugnantium modo fiat loco certo eoque privato secreto ut conscientiis suis satisfaciant ut nulla ex ea varietate occasio manifesta detur subditis regni ad violendas leges ecclesiasticas et cum multa alia petenda sunt serenissimo duce ut per christianissimum regem fratrem suum per seipsum pactis caveantur ut juramentis etiam confirmentur quemadmodum oratoribus non est negatum nec tamen clausula subsequens eodem modo ab ipso serenissimo duce exigenda obtinenda est quo presens hoc responsum superioribus tribus clausulis contentum sua majestate regia postulabitur quae dicenda sunt ex parte ducis serenissimus dux non diutius utetur ritibus ceremoniis haud consentientibus cum legibus angliae quam quoad institutus persuasus fuerit ut ecclesiae anglicanae ritus sufficientes esse existimet ad cultum divinum neque ii quidem consentientibus cum legibus angliae ita utetur ut aut bonis subditis regni ad publicam offensionem aut mali ad violandas leges prebeatursed semper quum publicae offensiones huic aut acciderint aut indubitate ad futurae videbuntur unde tumultus regno metui possint se adomnes suae majestatis benevolas admonitiones cum pro honore securitate suae majestatis quam pro communi tranquilitate regni conservanda modo forma se geret ut reginae consilio suo par esse atque conveniens videbitur idem que per omnia permittit se prestiturum pro omnibus domesticis qui cum illo permittenter ad esse aliquo suo cultu religioso postremo quia regiae majestati visum est oratores falsos esse se non habuisse potestatem ii premissis ut proponuntur plene assentiendi aequum esse etiam visum est suae majestati ut illa responsa non tradantur tanquam ita mature consult determinata sua majestate quin ut liceat suae majestati detrahere aut ad ea aliquid adjicere impost erum et eo magi quia non fine multa persuasione cohortatione consiliorum suorum ad astentiendum multis praedictorum adducta est et id circo etiam majestas sua petit christianissimo fratre suo rege christianissimo ut quanquam haec quae sua majestate responsa sunt non sunt per omnia regi placitura nulla tamen diminutio mutuae amicitiae prioris intersuas majestates subsequatur quia nihil poti habet votis sua majestas quam amicitiam mutuam cum

treschrestien fait par mr le grand tresorier le marc que se maj voyant que le roy treschristien son bon frere la royne sa perseuerent en le honeste desir de demander son alliance encore que de puis le mois de aoust dernier plusieurs choses soient entrevennes de la coste par le quelles ell une grande occasion de ne suiure le propos neant moins le prochas elle returne maintenant aux mesmes termes le choses en estoient dem ures le du dit mois aoust lors que elle seant en son con eil kellingworth present le sr de la mott fist une forme de response au dit sr ambas suivant la quelle elle dit de noveau que pour le bien de s subjectes lesquels monstrent de preveoir beaucoup de grandes dangiers en ce royaume si elle le de laisse sans quelque lignee prouvenant de elle et sans successeur fin de le satesfaire quelle est firmement resolue de se marier de quelque bon et grand lieu selon elle si elle peult trouver quelqun qui elle et son estate soit convenable et sur le offre que le maj treschristienes luy font de mr le duc alanson le frere et fils elle trouve que la partie est fort honorable si toutes autres choses pe vent convenir dont estime quil en consiste une bonne partie en lenterveue deux deux tant cause de linequalite de l aage que pour le rapport que ceux qui ont veu le du ont fait de son visage fin de veoir sily aura mutuel consentement entre ux car ainsi elle tousiours respondu toutes autres prince qui lont recerche ce quun chascun scait bien que beaucoup ont faict qu elle ne achepteroit jamais aucun pour mary si elle ne l eust primierement veue que neant moins pour le miscontentement et autres displaisirs que pourroient succeder de la dit entreve e si dadventure le choses ne sortient effect craignant pour cela quelque diminution damitie en lieu quelle la veut augmenter elle ne scait que desirer la dessus advis remettant le maj treschristienes le point entreveue scachant trop bien quelles ne consillerent rien leur frere et le il qui ne soit selon son honeur esperant quil nen serum aucun mauvaise interpretation tant quelle procede simplement et sincerement encore quil puisse avoir le honores et amies si fault il que le affection de deux costes soient absolues en quo le gre de nul autre ne puist servir sinon celui de party quelle entend que ce pendant qui toutes le article qui nt este consentu par cy devant et trouves bons pour sa maj au prop de mr demeurant entiers pour mr muant seulement le reserve linterpretation ou esclaircissement de doubtes sur le article de la religion ceque serum remi estre determine par elle et mr le duc lentreveue quelle voit bien quant l article aura maintenant plus de difficulte quil neust e au paravant par le evenements de france considerant le course quil semble que le roy tien contre le subject pour le religion agreant acelle angleterre mesmement luy recorder celle partie de sa religion que consiste principalement en sa messe attendu le scandale que toutes le consellers disent quil pourroient en ce temp advenir de luy permetre pour estre chose trop contre la saincte parolle de dieu et aux loix establies pour la religion receus en angleterre de sorte que outre le scrupule de sa propre conscience elle estime que bien peu de si n le luy vouldront conseiller ayant cause de present estre plus soigneux quils nont estre parcy devant que neantmoins sur ceque le dit grand tresorier dict quil luy remonstre qu encore quelle ne deust trouver en mr le duc toutes perfection quelle desireroit autant quil en plusieurs grandes et louables et quil est de tres illustre et royalle extraction et que cest present qu une partie tant honorable luy est offert avec tant serieux moiens tant par le roy et sa mere comme par la continuelle pour suitte par messagiers et lettres de duc mesmes comme tousiours et que le tout court elle de se marier par ainsi quil ne fault quelle sarreste petite difficultes quelle dict quelle se veult encliner pour l amour de s subject nonobstant quelle vit aucunes choses non du tout sa satisfaction dendurer aucuns defaultes et quelle ne vouldroit faire si ne foit pour la necessite de son mariage contenter son royaume quelle ne nie point ce que le dict grand tresorier luy pareillement remonstre touchant le point de la religion que plusieurs choses moiennant quelles ne soient directement contre le parolle de dieu comme il dict estre quelque part de la messe se peuvent laisser aller par connivence quautrement ne le ottroient pa et quil moins de scrupule et moins de scandale de ne le contredire que si par expresse declaration le authoriseroit par ou le dict sr tresorier pense quen telles et semblables moindres choses sa conscience se pourroit acquiescer esperant que monsieur le duc sestant accoustume avec lexercise de la religion anglet trouveroit avec le temp plus de raison de sen lover que peut estre de la religion de france car il est manifest quen le plus part de choses celle anglet ne varie point de la remaine forsque en language quest ce quelle peut respondre et ainsi leur faire dire par son ambass de par de la et le grand tresorier adjouste que suivant ce que dessus estant fort presse par le dict sr amb dire quelque chose de ce quil pensoit il dict quil ne pouvoit aucunement penser si non que si mr le duc trouve bon de prendre la poste avec une moderie compagne pour venir par de en ce prin temp comme en may ou semblable temp pour veoir la royne ce quil pourroit faire sans le prejudice de luy considerant la grandeur de sa maj et quil na aucun estat souverain ains lhoneur destre duc et frere du roy et comme une june prince desirant aussy de travailler et veoir le pais il pourra en ceste sorte venir greenwich ou en quelque autre lieu icy pres de londres kent ou bien la parte ou la royne lors se trouvera quil auroit bonne esperance que laffaire se conduiroit une bonne et heureuse conclusion car accordant quil se peult trouve autant agreeable comme plusieurs fait rapport puis nagueres en ce que la picotte de la petite verolle soit toute effacee ny voyont difficulte importance que celle de la religion et quand le mutuel consentement se trouvera aux personnes il esperoit que la religion ne lempeschera et quily aura encore de conseilliers qui voudront ainsi adviser que mr le duc le puisse contenter avec une telle tolleration pour lexcercize daucuns point de la religion que noffenceroient lestat de ce royaume de autres propos du dict sr grand tresorier sest comprins que la dicte dame la coeur et sa affection entiers vers le roy en la royne sa mere vouloir demurer jamais le bonne confederee ainsi quelle pense bien aussy qu ux de leux costes luy correspondent mais quil ne voit pa que ce la puisse lon uement durer non obstant sa presente urage intention preserver et garder la traicte de sa part attendu le deportements de la france lesquels luy semblent que tendent fort deprimer le protestant la ou ce royaulme ne pe faire que le porter faveur ce que serum occasion si le mariage ne succede que peu peu toute la seurte de la ligue se ira perdre et ny aura traicte ny serment ny commerce ny lettres ny bonnes parolles que luy puissent regarder car il vouloit dire librement que comme il pensoit par le opinion de plus sage que la royne sa maistresse ne pourroit faire quen fin elle et son estat ne fussent contraicte de suiure le deliberation et le generales resolution que se prendront par le prince protestant pour la defense de la religion et pour assister aux attempt de ceux qui voudroint invahir ce royaume dont pour toucher le paix tout inconvenients que pourroient
