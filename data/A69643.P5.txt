ecliptic goeth parallell equinoctiall changing declination slowly length day little altered example sun neare unto equinoctiall side dayes increase also decrease suddenly apace place ecliptic inclineth equinoctiall manner like straight line making sensible declination againe sunne neare greatest declination height summer depth winter dayes keep good time one stay place ecliptic manner parallel equinoctiall length day differeth little declination scarce altering two time yeare sunne standeth still one declination called summer solstice winter solstice wherefore wee may hereby
