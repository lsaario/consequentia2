double cube v three line x v continual proportion cntinuing semicircle v x till cut line r drawn produced z line z equal x drawing x z pas four line v x z equal therefore joyning x z figure v x z rectangle produce c p p equal z produced fall p three rectangle equiangled triangle p x x v consequently four continual proportional p x▪ v whereof x least mean therefore cube x double cube v thats true cube double cube x cube p double cube z produced fall upon p thing deny ought demonstrate b z produced fall p draw p v let fall perpendicular upon p suppose u divide p v midst joyn u done u equal v p v u p right angle point u semicircle whereof p v diameter therefore drawing v r angle u v r right angle b v equal sequal v also equal v p r equal parallel r equal parallel p v therefore v r p joyn equal parallel angle p u v r v u alternate consequently equal p u v right angle therefore also r v u right angle hitherto evident proceed b point raise perpendicular cutting v r wheresoever p v r parallel angle v right angle figure u v rectangle u equal v v equal z x therefore z x equal u u must pas point diameter rectangle divide middle therefore z u point x point therefore z produced fall upon p x lesser two mean v cube x double cube v demostraten cannot imagine fault demonstration yet one thing seems little strange ti take b r half diagonal sine 45 degree also mean proportional two extreams yet bring none propriety demonstration though argue construction yet argue cause perhaps adversary object least art demonstratieon enqure luck pitched upon half diagonal foundation b see let
