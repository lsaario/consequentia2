think nothing shew wicked perversness writer mind passage could know well divine assert deity essentially necessarily good mean goodness thing extrinsical divine nature much le something hath dependance upon excellency perfection nature every thing exactly conformable right reason therefore certainly wilful perversion sense set purpose overthrow notion moral goodness deity vain tell u deity act sub ratione boni subject fate time asserts god every respect necessary agent without free nay without knowledge understanding nature plain demonstration chief primary design banish men mind notion moral goodness nothing therefore tho resolved introduce absolute necessity action divine human yet one leave umbrage distinction good evil foundation reward punishment notion necessity writer follow democritus heraclitus leucippus atheistical sect maintaind nothing nature matter motion therefore modern writer assert nothing universe body run fate farther old heathen patron necessity none democritick sect supposed fate power man particular even deserted epicurus observe pythagoreans platonist stoicks agreed mind man free ti well known stoicks free power man found arrogant assertion wise man one respect excellent god good necessity nature could help whereas man power otherwise therefore commendable indeed poet philosopher subject god fate necessity thus seneca one place saith necessitas deos alligat irrevocabilis divina pariter ac humana cursus vehit ille ipse omnium conditor ac rector scripsit quidem fata sed sequitur semper paret semel jussit opinion effectually refuted exposed lucian dialogue called 〈 nonlatin alphabet 〉 also lactantius first book de falsâ religione chap 11 doubt seneca others understood softer sense first sight appears doctrine generally heathen fully believe prayer sacrifice would alter man fortune circumstance better would appease anger gain favour blessing god nature absolutely fatal necessary could freely deal creature according deserved hand find balbus stoick mentioned cicero telling u nature god would powerful excellent subject necessity nature quâ coelum maria terrae que reguntur nihil enim est praestantius deo nulli igitur est naturae obediens subjectus writer tread step worst atheistical heathen philosopher maintain rigid fate irresistible necessity 2 come next shew groundlesness reason argument men build hypothesis absolute necessity first reason mr hobbs chief brings freedom human action saith mr hobbs deliberation alternate succession contrary appetite ti last call immediately action next become impossible also nothing saith take beginning self must action immediate agent without therefore man hath something cause willing self something else disposing whereas ti controversie voluntary action necessary cause said also caused thing whereof disposeth follows voluntary action necessary cause therefore necessitated agen also every sufficient cause saith necessary one produce effect necessarily twas something wanting production sufficient hence follows whatsoever produced produced necessarily consequently voluntary action necessitated define free agent thing present necessary produce effect nevertheless produce contradiction nonsense ti one say cause may sufficient e necessary yet effect shall follow substance mr hobbs proof free almost many mistake sentence hence plainly appear either clear idea wrote else designedly endeavour perplex darken confound cause first place confounds power faculty willing man last act willing determination deliberating consequently doth distinguish school would call hypothetical absolute necessity yet ought carefully done point u agent may free doubt every man free deliberate compare object offered choice yet hath chosen indeed necessity come ti impossible one choose choose determine determine election made one ever supposed man free make therefore mr hobbs mean last act willing electing immediately precedes acting next thing become impossible expresseth fight shadow opposes body ever denied man ever supposed freedom determination thing man determined free whether would determine accordingly defines voluntary agent hath made end deliberating tripos p 311 agen 2 ti hard know mean nothing taking beginning self talking voluntary action freedom human nature therefore referr man instance afterwards produce contingent thing ibid 315 nothing purpose spoken signifie grant nothing take beginning man took beginning god voluntary action say take beginning faculty power willing placed soul doth follow thence action call voluntary necessitated take original free power election god hath placed nature dare say one see consequence part argument least follow hence cause man willing self something else disposing yet boldly asserts power willing faculty find self free many case act act act particular manner generally called commonly said free tho think one hath observed mr lock essay humane understanding proper way speaking say man free besides ti usual indeed proper predicate one faculty another ti hardly good sense say free manner explaind would thing say free power free whereas power man hath power free however way expression hath prevailed doth dont think one misled error every body understands mean saying man free man hath nature free power called hence follow man free whether must someway either act act act particular manner follow man hath made particular volition hath determined point whether shall act forbear act longer liberty particular case instant determination actually made man longer free make prof nothing liberty freedom mind man doth mr hobbs mean will necessary cause voluntary action doth mean man must necessity act freely produce action voluntarily doth agreed mean previously necessitated every act volition doth could possibly willed otherwise beg question take granted great thing dispute ti call controversie thing controversie indeed man contradicts common sense reason mankind without proof best way proceeding look like argument necessity humane action brings last place cause saith sufficient cause wanteth nothing requisite produce effect cause must also necessary one necessarily produced effect must something wanting purpose could sufficient whatever produced produced necessarily could without sufficient necessary cause therefore also voluntary action necessitated prof purpose think nothing proceeds former error confounding act willing power willing making hypothetical absolute necessity dispute saith every sufficient cause necessary one allowing ever volition determination made ever voluntary action done man sufficient cause produce effect nay last necessarily produce inferr nothing hence hath determined willed ti longer free nill particular thing particular instant dont believe body ever ever deny prove necessitated make determination à priori could made yet mean ought clearly made power faculty liberty enabled make determination would sufficient cause made another contrary differing made would necessary former therefore definition free agent thing present needful produce effect nevertheless produce tho dont think best doth rightly understood imply contradiction nonsense meaning properly free hath power determination requisite ready nothing shall extrinsecally either hinder compel act yet choose whether act thus man hath pen ink paper place write upon hand well liberty understands write hath thing present needful produce effect writing yet nevertheless produce effect choose whether write mr hobbs defines free agent forbear liberty absence external impediment tripos p 314 intended thing palliate bad cause amuse person wrote much nonsense contradiction advance necessity possible man said act necessarily hath external
