subject shew longitude may found jupiter satellite would power advance way far transcends others yet known especially logline therefore hope reader excuse digression way find longitude eclipse jupiter four satellite briefly knowing table satelliteeclipses suppose mr flamsteed published philos transact afterwards gave parker leave publish almanacks knowing say time eclipse happeneth one part world

great digression especially monsieur ca ni hath ingeniously well done first shall therefore refer reader table reduced meridian style london judicious mathematician mr halley philos trans reader hope pardon leave digression observe thing may use calculation eclipse outermost satellite also may contract labour calculation first first thing observed jupiter place aphelion move slowest consequently satellite make return somewhat sooner mean distance perihelion mr flamsteed first table first satellite make revolution jupiter day h aphelion mean distance perihelion second satellite make revolution

light jupiter body mean hindred seeing one may perhaps hereby see thus instance august first satellite immerges h p cannot seen reason day light also jupiter shadow lieth little left body add one whole obscuration viz twice emersion find visible h according mr flamsteed h according monsieur cassinis table another instance make yet plain oct h p satellite emerge substracting one obscuration viz twice h find immersion fall h p may seen reason jupiter good distance opposition sun shade lie far left hand admit seeing satellite jupiter body shade might added diver remark particularly concerning equation light time light passeth sun jupiter last settled sagacious observer often mentioned mr flamsteed must forbear fearing already wearied reader patience shall need pardon detaining long subject small occasion satellite instrument watchwork willing small occasion rather say something excite observation enquiry others concerning matter may vast use navigation making correcting map country c many matter would greatest use scarce ever heard others except monsieur cassini backward favouring world observation necessary calculation indeed novel subject full difficulty little hath written concerning first material observation relied hodiernas mr rook former published accurate latter accurate published neither yet year old neither novelty difficulty ought discourage curious diligent excite partly design digression iii correct motion royal pendulum chap preceding book judged good expedient bring pendulum vibrate nicely add bob underneath pendulum ball since found succeed much

nicely perform rest great ball usual weight form swing second would corrector regulating bob ounce troy scrw beneath ball directed chap endeavour kind must expected movement still exposed influence weather alteration caused foulness easy quick bringing pendulum swing second true length composed following table sheweth alteration made hour screwing letting great ball therefore ball run upon rule divided inch tenth inch ti easy see much little ball needeth altered pendul length variation vibrat ten min sec faster slower table need little explication ball inch tenth would swing second alter inch tenth would go faster inch tenth would go slower rest table iv equation natural day reason sun motion orbit equal although moved equal arch ecliptick equal time yet would come meridian unequal
