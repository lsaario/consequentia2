water thus turne water like roach kinde turning man swimming vpon belly head one way suddainly turne himselfe stil vpon belly bring head body way done quickly oft time may see fish within water pleasant heate sommer wantonly friske fro commonly called koach turne done thus turne towards right hand hee must suddainely put water left hand pull water behinde towards right hand turning backe head bodie see next figure turne bell turne water also turning called bell turne one swimming one bellie shall suddainely pull feete stead striking afore sayd shall heauing backward forepart strike

grasse doone thus swimming belly backe way hee meaneth roule himselfe towards right hand left hee must thrust hand broadwayes downe water palme downward hee must carry close beside ready vse vpon side vppermost legge still hee turneth strike superficies water motion hande helpeth turne ouer body striking foot keepeth better vp hindmost part heauie themselues picture following strike superficies water strike superficies water foure part body twice thus doone lying vpon backe somthing declining body towards left side hand must bee water labouring fro like finne fishe keepe sinking may hee lift

forth againe maner slide forward vpon belly water must thus done must keepe hand together palmes downwards must drawe water towards feete also legges kept close together hee must easilie thrust keepe well keeping together wise best vsed riners many high weedes swimming vpon belly thus shall safelier slyde ouer sitte water exercise kinde swimming must one troubled crampe forceable bending backward body otherwise dangerous must thus done lying vpon barke must drawe feete towards hippes vse motion hand vnder water sustaine till hee hath gotten hys legges hand thus vsing small motion put forward keeping onely brest head aboue water streame easily keepe vp reason concauitie backe pare toe water swimming vpon backe let drawe vp left foote lay ouer right knee still keeping body straight hauing knife readie right hand may easilie keepe vp legge vntill hath pared one toe thus shew foure part body aboue water must lie straight vpon backe lay one legge ouer knee vppermost knee may easily seene

aboue water stryking vnder water legge driue forward hand easily mouing side better keepe vp example carrie thing drie ouer water hand onely done swimming vpon backe strayning himselfe lye straight body holde armes straight vp else force bend bodie shall sincke holding armes vpward afore may easilie carrie recarry thing ouer water without wetting example stroake legge pulling boote nothing el lying straight vpon backe extraordinarie feates suddenly lifting one leg aboue water stroake hand manner caper legges aboue water lying vpon backe straight afore hand palmes downwards pressing water better keepe vp must cast legges water caper vpward men vse doe downward dauncing thus diue vnderneath water must hee place way stand vpon ground much force leape vp bending head towards brest fall forward downe water thus hand hee must holde head backes together may ready pull forcing downe vnder water must pulling nowe vse helpe downe weare afore meanes holde vp feete also must strike vpward moueing manner doth swimming aboue water vpon belly example swimme vnder water hath thus buried himselfe water hee must thrust hand sorth head drawe water beate behinde stryke feete swimming vpon
