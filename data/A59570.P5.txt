tender mercy work say god deal arbitrarily creature dispenseth good evil meerly without reason truth disparage nature give u notion perhaps great monarch world far esteeming best men certainly mankind find self wiser better grow le led humour shake indifferency good evil steadily cleave eternal law reason righteousness action may sure god wisdom iustice goodness self never action dealing creature depart principle true scheme god almighty government plainly infinite mind clearly understood possibility thing long actual knew thing possible would act put event acting would infinite goodness moved put actual every thing saw good give power action withal look motion action last praise glory goodness first enclined create infinite wisdom contrived method brought pas laid scheme platform thing nothing could happen whole creation beginning world end thereof tho self never bad never mischievous might ordered subservient end lastly scheme thing thus laid infinite power first produced thing
