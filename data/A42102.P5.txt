wherewith wrote dispute confess would something shew truth notion mixture far u good done u much harm seeming subtlety real absurdity many phantastick spectrum serving affright men coming near subject whereof treat shall therefore endeavour open true nature mixture shall build doctrine upon common notion sense none deny every one may conceive order shall take leave lay proposition principle mixed body sect ii first principle mean atomes certain sort atomes simplest body otherwise would principle compounded principle strict speaking contradiction even five three two principle number vnites whence secondly follows also indivisible mathematically atomes every principle dimension physically one cannot made two asked whether stick cut knife one made two say stick one body many million body atomes one whereof divided within self separated knife forceth way drawing man finger heap corn division made one grain separation one another remaining still entire say therefore physically one also firm indivisible impenetrable penetration separation division atomes hence thirdly also immutable cannot divided cannot changd whole world atomes one hath ever sufferd suffer least mutation hereupon grounded constancy cause effect generation le certain self principle still propagated man man wherefore compounded body generated principle propagated every generation pas unaltered one body another principle atomes immutable follows diver kind one principle kind atomes still make thing effect generation would wherefore since immutable must diver diversity reason small numerous world taken together nature shop principle thing tool material wherefore speaks goodness shop perfection vniverse furnished many tool wherewith many material whereupon work consequently philosophy beareth best name doth strain two three principle like two three bell steeple making pittiful chime tryeth rise nature number ring change world yet doth vast diversity take away regiment subordination principle certain lesser number either greater quantity way rule dominion several order rest whereever subject multitude order part perfection order proportion nature imagind hold proportion thing else wherefore certainly order government part rational certainly material world whence although specie principle numerous yet principle called galenical chymical others way fall notice sense notwithstanding reduceable smaller number viz according number predominant principle nature least part vniverse near round u power empire whereof principle submit submission quitting nature appearance

upon two therefore figure regular regularity similitude continud since therefore kind atomes diver size figure self size figure common certain number atomes could said one kind consequently similitude atomes could distinction principle hence also two mode atomes viz size figure true original quality atomes atome certain size figure lastly two mode taken severally quality atome considerd together form substantial form body unintelligible thing say body although rational soul substantial form yet form man body form body conceive otherwise modification body complexion mode body also agrees definition form amongst peripatetick philosopher well enough accepted viz quod sit ratio ejus essentiae quae cuique rei competit ratio referred body modification body thus proposed summary thought principle shall next proceed shew mixture sect iii first premiss arrive conclusion sc formation transformation body nothing else mixture body principle immutable proved therefore generable formable transformable form principle mode also immutable whole business material world nothing else mixture nature worketh every mixture mixture every one thing one whether mixture great body small compound atomes every mixture mixture body wherefore mixture either intelligible affection body none latter man say many wayes therefore see conceive mixture gross body hold hand many way may subtilest mixture nature maketh atomes wayes wayes distinguish mixture general two either respect body mixed else mode mixture self respect body mixed mixture distinguished also two way viz conjugation proportion conjugation mean certain mixture principle others threefold first number one body may compounded two principle another three third four fourth five secondly kind though conjunction number yet kind thirdly differ one another number kind many way principle body may conceived conjugated therefore may consequence clear first nature hath various material wherewith make mixture shewd secondly mixture may without concurrence imaginary form must produce variety material world likewise hath said wherefore since imaginable mixture may made purpose nature would imperfect self think might put material use would think therefore kind principle element go make every compounded body conceit credited one tell u kind wheel part watch put clock material wherewith build house tent ship nature great artificer perfect work made feigned cram ram thing one self look upon absurd secondly mixture principle diversifid conjugation also proportion diver quantity several principle part mixed together quantity one five ten second five fifteen third five twenty c one five six second six seven third seven eight proportion mixture may varied innumerable way mixture varied respect body mixed likewise respect mixture self call location principle mode conjunction may various well conjugation proportion yet reduceable unto two general mode body therefore principle mixed either mediation contact contact whether compound atomes way answerable figure whereof therefore conceive three general way viz first contact point smaller part two atomes meet globular otherwise gibbose secondly contact plain conjunction side triangular quadrangular atomes otherwise flat thirdly contact concave one atome admitted concave hole another spigot fosset first may called apposition second application third reception intrusion two last wayes atomes may joyned mediation best last two extreams one atome received concaves hole two others general way whereby conceive body mixed together sc various conjugation proportion location composition atomes body like letter word thunderclap would word wherein four twenty letter packd one therefore compounded another fewer others conjugation proportion location letter varied every word whereby many thousand differing word without alteration letter might ten time many like manner therefore self analogous way letter alphabet principle word principle alphabet thing said principle mixture consequent thereupon may foundation intelligible account nature cause intrinsick property quality body gravity levity fixity fluidity angularity roundness heat cold blackness whiteness sowerness sweetness fragrancy fetidness many say intelligible account sc grounded upon notion sense made mechanically exemplification hereof large field one lecture shall come cause mixture deduce premiss following corollary first alteration principle element perfect mixture body cannot principle immutable said could yet needeth also many compoundable infinite way hath shewed need perplex self difficulty arise doctrine alteration element ground conceit four element element must need every body men puzled thence make infinite variety body feigned alterable alterd upon every perfect mixture considering four element alterable fewer three may spared one element alterable may made hence secondly may solved great dispute whether call lixivial salt made fire first principle made fire principle unalterable therefore unmakeable secondly must therefore distinguish betwixt principle modification principle various mixture principle whence may receive various denomination wherefore lixivial salt qua lixivial certainly made fire quatenus salt principle extractable body diver way fire whether calcine body ferment manner shewd diligent curious improver chymical knowledg dr daniel coxe else putrifie ground drown sea still yieldeth kind salt salt made making saline principle variously mixed upon various way solution body principle various mixture receives various denomination marine nitrous volatile lixivial hence thirdly perfect mixture body go higher contact principle unalterable matter impenetrable hath said visible laxe mixture contact subtile perfect generation self nothing hence fourthly easily understand diver principle belonging vegetable many body also actually existent body man even generation transmutation principle translated one body another vegetable animal least alterd mixture conjugation proportion location varied hence also difference mixture arising difference contact intelligible sc three degree congregation vnion concentration congregation inconsistent mixture several atomes touch point smaller part manner diver argument inducing believe atomes fluid body qua fluid touch vnion touch plain crystal shooting salt like body pursue divided subdivided part eye far still terminate every side plain wherefore ti intelligible atomes also terminate therefore touch plain concentration two atomes touch reception intrusion one another closest firmest mixture fixed unodorable untastable body atomes body able make smell tast unless first dissolved say unpind one another hence sixthly understand case seemeth penetration body sense may admitted viz mean penetration intrusion intrusion one atome concave hole another kind penetration whereby take le room mixed body would way contact naked knife sheath take almost double room knife sheathed whence may assign reason many liquor mixed take le room space apart ingenious hook maketh appear experiment say plain reason hereof least one reason intrusion many atomes one another yet penetration body strictly called nature maketh mixture mixture contact ti evident natural artificial mixture seeming subtilties whereby philosopher gone distinguish many scarcrows affright men imitation nature lastly hence follows art self may go far nature doth say far nothing make mix material already made hand even nature self hath said maketh nothing new mixeth thing far therefore govern mixture may nature doth may still better understand let u next place see cause mixture since natural artificial mixture immediate cause must sect iv cause mixture conceive must think reduced six general viz congruity weight compression solution digestion agitation congruity aptitude respondence betwixt size figure part mixed whereby body may truly called instrumental cause mixture plain answer plain square square convex concave le greater equal c according respondencies part body le easily mingleable weight mean whereof fluid body upon supposition congruity part must unavoidably mingle compression either air body added weight must degree mixture weight self pression proof said cause made experiment let oyl aniseseeds oyl vitriol put apart receiver airpump exhausted air let two said oyls affused one upon whereupon first visible mix coagulate together part wedged intruded one another without usual compression air exhausted therefore congruity receiving intruding part weight alone compressed make intrusion secondly also evident although coagulate yet altogether much powred together manner quantity open air wherefore compression whether made air thing else doth somewhat mixture body greater compression solution body mix best forma fluida two reason first part body state vnion separation therefore capable state mixture vnion part another body secondly also state motion le therefore continual tendency towards mixture mixture made motion wherefore generation perfect mixture nature made fluid whether animal vegetable mineral also agreeable doctrine honourable mr boyle excellent treatise nature vertues gem ti well known body ordinarilypetrified stone made water petrifying part dissolved per minimum water menstruum vehicle wherefore talk making gold must philosopher stone philosopher liquor digestion reason mixture solution first heat doth attenuate still separate part body render mingleable part another therefore secondly doth also add motion order mixture agitation induced believe great effectual mean mixture upon diver consideration first making blood body animal mixing chyle therewith much promoted mean sc agitation part blood chyle continual circulation making butter milk mean whereby alone made separation oleous part whey mixture together moreover great effect digestion well known conversant chymical preparation digestion self kind insensible agitation part digested body ti also known experiment readiest way dissolve sugar wine liquor give vessel hasty turn together smart knock hard steady body whereby part sugar liquor put vehement agitation immediately mixed together remember intent make mr mathewss pill put oyl turpentine salt tartar together bottle sent hither country found continual agitation upon road three four day done towards mixture far greater time digestion alone done certain vehement agitation especially continud joyned digestion accelerate mixture body ten time bare digestion alone may proved many experiment instance one let oyl turpentine good spirit nitre stopd together bottle bottle held fire till liquor little heated begin bubble removed bubble degree increasing two liquor last fall impetuous ebullition make kind explosion sending forth smoak space almost two yard high whereupon part liquor violently agitated great portion incorporated thick balsam moment without intense heat may felt bottle thus much cause mixture sect v enumerated general cause shall lastly enquire power vse mixture teach shall instance six particular first render body sociable whatsoever secondly make artificial body imitation nature production thirdly make imitate sensible quality bod e smell tasts fourthly make imitate faculty fifthly key discover nature body sixthly discover vse manner medicinal operation instance first render body sociable ngleable water oyl salt spirit like natural artificial mixture proved therefore nature see generation body doth ti likewise power art two general rule result premiss sc application cause choice material cause instancd application shall give two rule first tread nature step near application cause may proper mixture also allowing sufficient time effect see nature self perfect mixture usually doth maketh flower apple horse man moment thing degree perfect elaborate mixture part requireth time mixture made carrid per minimum therefore require greater time compleating second rule make due application cause sometimes accumulate mean may imitate nature case go beyond adding graft bud stock may produce fruit sooner sometimes better nature stock alone would accumulating cause mixture joyning three four together applying case nature applyeth fewer may able make perfect yet far speedy mixture nature doth joyning compression heat violent agitation continuing together mean contrived purpose space week moneth longer without cessation may probably produce strange useful effect solution mixture body may serve mix body small number congruous part hardly mingleable way agitation carrying key fro till hit lock within lock till hit ward secondly choice material immediately mingleable turn one specie mixture rule mix mediation third whether simple compounded body may congruous part sulphurious salt water oyl reason mingleable either two congruous body also part congruous two others like way whereby part body though never heterogeneous may yet bound lockd together even twenty key may united uniting two ring whereon hang consideration thing put upon making several experiment mingling heterogeneous body shall give two example tryal one upon fluid upon consistent body first took oyl aniseseeds powring upon another body orderd thereby turned perfect milkwhite balsam butter mean said oyl became mingleable liquor oyl wine water easily instantaneously dissolving therein form milk note done without least alteration smell tast nature operation said oyl somewhat like mean oyl aniseseeds stillatitious oyl may transformed perfect milk white butter like manner mingled water liquor various use medicine find oftentimes convenient advantageous done fluid consistent body themselvs mix oyl due mixture body maybe renderd easily dissoluble water may rosin resinous friable gum also wax without changing much colour tast smell whereof likewise whatsoever others may physician may make manifold vse instance ii mixture also may taught imitate production nature said mixture may conclude generation body unorganical power mixture imitate animal imitate blood fat chyle spittle flegm bile c vegetable imitate milk mucilage rosin gum salt mineral imitate vitriol allom salt also metal like say upon good premiss may conclude may done one step also give instance somewhat may done every kind first imitation animal body instance fat may made thus take oyl olive powr upon high spirit nitre digest day degree oyl becomes colour marrow last congealed hardned white fat butter dissolveth fire animal converting oyl thus fat noted hardens upon exhalation sulphureous part spirit nitre effected well enough purpose unstopping glass time digestion suffering oyl dissolve thicken diver time successive heat cold hence true congealing principle spirit nitre separated sulphur better whereof air commodious menstruum said spirit nitre whence also could procure spirit nitre might congele water midst summer might also refrigerate room herewith artificially might imitate frosty meteor making fat durable congelation oyl may done without frost shewd hence also appears animal fat self curdling oily part blood either saline part nitrous part air mingled therewith hence likewise animal cony fieldfare grow fatter frosty weather oily part blood ordinarily coagulated greater abundance nitrous part received air body reason fat landanimals hard whereas fish soft great part run oyl sc water wherein live instead breath hath nitrous part comparison air hath imitation vegetable body give three instance rosin gum lixivial salt first may made thus take good oyl vitriol drop upon oyl aniseseeds forthwith incorporate together degree harden perfect rosin general defining property truly natural resinous gum least dissoluble water least natural rosin gum yet easily fire also highly inflammable exceeding friable although artificial rosin result two liquor strongly affect sense yet well washed unincorporated part done care hath scarce tast smell concentration two liquor likewise universal rosin made precipitation almost total combination said liquor scarce much visible fume taken certain powder saline liquor mixed together bottle digested time powder last transmuted perfect oily gum also dissolve either oyl water self manner galbanum ammoniac like lastly lixivial salt may imitated thus take nitre oyl vitriol high spirit wine like quantity three body two put together say neither nitre oyl oyl spirit nitre spirit make least ebullition yet three mingled together make conspicuous one spirit wine sulphur nitre together standing stead alkalizate sulphurious salt oyl vitriol diver experiment shew like nature last place imitation mineral body instance two sc nitre marine salt may leave reckon amongst mineral body nitre mixing four liquor together setting shoot obtained crystal true perfect salt much nitrous tast would melted gentle heat nitre even easily butter self mean addition sort liquor body dissolve fire seasalt might imitate nature making hereof considerd salt called nothing else animal vegetable salt freed true spirit sulphur saline particle specifically animal vegetable together animal vegetable body continually carried river sea many likewise shipwrack diver way immersed therein last corrupted compounding part opened resolved yet resolution water made precipitately air degree gently whence sulphurious volatile part avolation make much hast carry fixed saline part along leaveth behind water imbibeth proper menstruum imitation

body reason even dependance upon substantial form first part last book anatomy vegetable think line clearly made meer result mixture effected cause whether nature art also premiss discourse hath shewd instance v whence likewise key discover nature body far soever attain mingle make may also know body mingleable either third mingle may certainly conclude congruity betwixt respect upon various tryals find essential oyls easily imbibe acid alkaly whence evident congruity similitude betwixt essential oyls acid betwixt said oyls alkaly mingle third may also certainly conclude though two extreams unlike yet similitude congruity third united moreover may make judgment manner degree mixture thus acid spirit nitre said coagulate oylolive render consistent whence might thought strong acid like therefore great difference nature said acid liquor contrary hereunto proved experiment digested oyl manner much longer time strong oyl sulphur although thence acquired change colour yet consistence said spirit nitre coagulates oylolive might expected effect upon oyl aniseseeds least acid coagulate oyl aniseseeds best experiment proveth contrary tryed oyl vitriol acid doth instantaneously oyl sulphur strong soon much aqua fortis spirit salt present touch spirit nitre self coagulate eight ten hour least instance vi lastly consequently key discover medicinal vse operation body thus example imitation rosin resinous gum certainly know wherefore used mastick frankincense olibanum benzoin like rosin resinous gum principal predominant part qua rosin body resulting natural like manner shewed
