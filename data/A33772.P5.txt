infinite accident body may infinite extension quality intension answer finite essence body cannot subject infinite accident infinite extension would see theorem therefore infinite say quality irrefragably conclude cannot two infinite being theorem vii infinite dividable first cannot divided two infinite being part cannot equal whole axiom two infinite theorem secondly divided two finites either finites may still conceived greater perfect axiom every finite thing something else may conceived equal addition may made axiom mean something would conceived great large perfect infinite axiom lastly divisible finite infinite finite taken away still infinite remains hence plainly appears cannot divided theorem viii infinite nothing would dividable viz cannot theorem theorem ix infinite

infinite neither part whole part must part either finite infinite finite part would greater whole infinite part would equal whole absurd contrary axiom neither whole whole whole consists part

finite thing self neineither essence existence essence since every finite thing included bound thing another finite self essence would follow beinu bounded self impose limit self another thing must

every finite hath infinite hath esse whereby whatever desinition first esse infinite theorem therefore c whatever must either self axiom nothing viz hath cannot give thing axiom finite thing self

consequence may assigned first finite being whereby rest produced self produced none circulation theorem first finite assigned shall still say self theorem hath either finite infinite cannot finite

infinite theorem therefore whatsoever independent theorem xxvii infinite eternal otherwise either hath theorem past self nothing actual existence theorem therefore infinite must need eternal rather eternity eternity self theorem xxviii real matter flow infinite self whereby may produce finite infinite would dividable theorem theorem xxix infinite produce finite simple act since real thing flow self whereby may produce finite theorem therefore must need produce immanent act meer act production finite thing must necessarily last come first thing produced infinite alone proved theorem innumerable thing producible equally indifferent produced therefore infinite go produce something self either thing possible produced produced together nothing plain false absurd else lastly must

finite peculiarly attributed simple act wil love will proper act power wisdom although infinite infinite wisdom power well infinite love yet produce produced understands self able produce will pleased

infinite being theorem therefore far finite infinite will far will far doth produce omnipotent infinite efficacious theorem therefore finite produced infinite thereby continually produced continual production usually call conservation ceasing finite immediately drop original nothing cease theorem xxxi infinite concurrs efficiently immediately real effect finite since infinite act continually produce finite giving power acting according last theorem therefore whatever moment finite doth act infinite will otherwise either give power acting vain would infinite wisdom theorem oratleast finite act contrary infinite would infinitely potent theorem far infinite will finite act produce new real effect far cause act will also produce efficacious theorem theorem xxxii every finite immediately depends infinite ti produced either infinite alone finite first truth theorem appears last since infinite doth efficiently immediately concur real effect finite theorem therefore also every finite produced another finite depends immediately infinite theorem xxxiii finite eternity since every finite hath infinite according theorem therefore suppose finite actually eternity since produced simple act infinite being theorem thereby continually producd theorem therefore infinite may finite shall hence forward everlasting twill follow duration included bound must infinite individable theorem consequence neither theorem therefore true eternity according definition infinite also eternal rather eternity self therefore eternity finite infinite two munerically first two eternity theorem second since eternity infinite entity theorem therefore infinite give finite eternity also give infinite entity finite must infinite hypothesis otherwise demonstrated thus finite actually existing producible eternity therefore finite could eternity would time act power implies would moment actually actually existing consequence plain antecedent proved thus every finite produced act infinite being
