de mhonorer comme jetois sur le point de vous en faire de excuse monsieur de l angle est arrive en ceste ville quime le fait encor differer dans lesperance qu il voudroit bien se charger de reponse qu elle pourroit par ce moien vous etre plus fidellement rendue il est vray monsieur que si jen croyois mon deplaisir je la remettrois encor une autre fois car je ne peux vous ecrire sans un extreme douleur quand je songe la matiere surla quelle vous commandes de vous dire mon sentiment ie croy que vous le scaves deja bien et que vous ne faites pa lhonneur de le demander comme en ayant quelque sorte de doute vous faites plus de justice que cela vous ne comprenez pa au nombre de ceux qui ont touchant l eglise angleterre une si mechante opinion pour moy je nen avois pa une si mechante daucun veritable anglois je ne pouvois pa persuader qu il en eut un seul qui crut quon ne peut estre dans sa communion sans hasarder son propre salut pour ceux qui sont engages dans le parti de l eglise romaine jen jugeois tout autrement il ont de maximes particuliers agissent par dautres interest mais pour ceux qui nont aucune liaison avec rome cest une chose bien singuliere de le voir passer jusqu cette extremite que de croire que dans l eglise anglicane ne peut faire son salut cest navoir gueres de conoissance de la confession defoy que tout le monde protestant si hautement approuvee qui merite en effect le louanges de tout ce quil de bons chrestiens car ne pouvoit rien faire de plus sage que cette confession jamais le article de foy nont ete recueillis avec un discernment plus juste plus raisonnable que dans cette excellent piece raison de la garder avec tant de veneration dans la bibliotheque oxford le grand iuellus pour lavoir si dignement defendue est digne dune louange immortelle cest delle dont dieu se servit dans le commencement de la reformation angleterre si elle navoit pa ete comme son ouvrage il ne lauroit pa benit dune facon si avantageuse le succes qu elle devroit fermer la bouche ceux qui sont le plus anime lavoir veue trionpher de tant obstacle devroit faire reconnoitre tout le monde que dieu sest declare en sa faveur quil est visiblement mele de son etablissement quelle la verite la fermete de sa parole qui elle doibt en effect sa naissance son origine elle est aujourdhuy ce quelle etoit quand elle toit formee ne peut pa reprocher monsieur le eveques quils ayent depuis cette terme la apporte quelque changement et comment donc simaginer quelle ayt change dusage peut rien voir de plus inique que de dire quun instrument que dieu employa autrefois pour linstruction de tant de gen de bien pour le salut de de tant de peuples pour la consolation tant de fidelles soit aujourdhuy devenue quelque chose de funeste pernicieuse si votre confession de foy est pure innocente votre service divin lest aussi car ny voit rien de tout qui tende lidolatrie vous nadores que dieu seul dans votre culte il ny rien qui se termine la creature si lon trouve quelques ceremony qui ne se rencontrent pa ailleurs cest faire profession dune terrible theologie avoir depouille toute charite ne scavoir guere ce que valent le ames ne conoitre point la nature de choses indifferentes que decroire quelles sont capables de perdre eternellement ceux qui sy veulent assujettir cest avoir une meme durete que de croire que votre discipline ecclesiastique est capable de damner le hommes car ou ton jamais vu que pour de article de discipline le salut de hommes se trouve interesse de choses qui ne regardent que le dehors lordre de l eglise et qui ne sont que comme lecorce le envelope de la verite peuvent elles causer la mort glisser du poison dans une ame certes ne le comprend jamais au nombre de verites essentielles comme il ny que celles cy qui sauvent il ny quelles aussi qui peuvent exclurre du salut pour le gouvernement episcopal qua til qui soit dangereux qui puisse raisonnablement alarmer de conscience sil est capable de priver de la gloire eternelle de boucher le avenue du ciel qui estce qui est entre lespace de plus de quinze cent an puisque pendant tout ce temp la toutes le eglises du monde nont point eu dautre gouvernement sil etoit contraire la verite laquisition du bonheur eternel est il croyable que dieu leut si hautement approuve quil eut permis que pendant tant de siecles son eglise en eust ete tyrannise car qui estce qui la gouverne qui estce qui compose s conciles tant generaux que particuliers qui estce qui combatu le heresy dont elle este de tout temp attaque ont ce pa ete le eveques n estce pa leur sage conduite que la parcle de dieu est redevable apres dieu de s victoires de s triomphes et sans remonter jusq au berceau la naissan ce de l eglise qui estce qui dans le siecle precedant delivra l angleterre de l erreur dont elle etoit envelopee qui estce qui fit resveiller si miraculeusement la verite fut ce pa le zele la fermete de eveques leur ministere degagea til pa le anglois de loppression sou laquelle il gemissoient de puis si long temp leur exemple aidat pa puissamment la reformation de toute l europe en verite je croy quils en pouvroient vser comme fift autre fois gregoire de nazianze au milieu de constantinople quand il arriva il trouva que l arrianismey avoit fait de fort grand progres cependant son courage son zele son scavoir affoblioent si fort le parti de heretiques quen peu de temp la verite apparut plus belle que jamais il voulut que le temple ou il lavoit si fortement appuiee portoit le nom anastasie parce quil ly avoit comme deterree degagee de dessous lerreur par s soins continuels il avoit comme fait sortir du tombeau glorieusement resuscitee cest ce quont fait aussi le evesques angleterre il voyoient non une verite seulement mais quasi toutes le verites fondamentales ensevelies sou un nombre espouvantables erreurs il voyoient le joug de rome plus pesant au milieu deux quil netoit nulle part ailleurs la difficulte quil avoit reussir dans la reformation etoit capable de decourager de personnes dune capacite dun zele mediocre neantmoins rien ne le detourne dun si gene reux dessein le ennemis de dehors ceux de dedans tous terribles quils parussent ne le intimident point il entreprenent ce grand ouvrage et ne labandonnent point quils nen soient venus au bout quils nayent remis sur le throne la verite resuscitee en sorte quils pouuoient lusser par tout de monument de ce miracle nommer justement toutes leur eglises du nom anastasie de resurrection mais si ce tiltre manque leur temple la chose en soy leur convient lon nentend ressonner au milieu deux que le lesson le louanges de la pure verite ce que doit obliger tous le gen de bien ne sen ecarter pa regarder l eglise anglicane comme une eglise tres orthodoxe cest ce qui font le protestant de france ceux de geneva ceux de suisse allemagne ceux hollande aussi car il se firent un fort grand honneur davoir dans leur concile de dordrecht de theologiens angleterre monstrerent bien quils avoient pour l eglise anglicane une profonde veneration et dou vient donc que de anglois meme en ont aujourdhuy si mechante opinion rompre si temerairement comme il font avec elle estce pa rompre avec toute l eglise ancienne avec toutes le eglises orientales avec toutes le eglises protestantes qui ont toujours fort considere la purete de celle angleterre estce pa une horrible durete que de lexcommunier sans misericorde sen faire etrangement croire que de simaginer quils soient le seuls en angleterre meme au milieu de tout le monde chrestien qui soient destines au bonheur eternel soustenir comme il faut le verites necessaires au salut certes pourroit faire un parallele fort odieux entre ce docteurs le pape victor qui volut excommunier le eglises asie par ce quelles ne celebroient le feste de pasque au meme jour que rome le faisoit entre eux le audiens qui rompoient avec le chrestiens ne vouloient point souffrir eveques rich entre eux le donatistes qui ne vouloient point de communion avec ceux qui avoient este ordines par de eveques laches qui simaginoient que leur societe etoit la veritable eglise lepouse bien aimee qui paissoit son troupeau vers le midi entre eux ceux de la communion romaine qui ont si bonne opinion de leur eglise que hors delle il ne simaginent pa quun puisse jamais acquerir le salut pour moy quelque enclin que je sois la tolerance je ne pourois pourtant persuader quil en faille avoir pour ceux qui en ont si peu pour le autres que sils etoient le maitres feroient assurement un mauvais quartier ceux qui dependroient deux ie regarde ce gen la comme de perturbateurs de lestat de leglise qui sont infalliblement anime dun esprit de sedition iay meme de la paine croire quils soient justement ce quils disent estre je craindrois bien que sou ce docteurs il ny eust de ennemis tres dangereux qui fussent cache de societes composees detelles personnes seroient extrement perilleuses ne le pourroit soufrir sans ouvrir la porte au disordre travailler asa propre ruine ily en de composees de personnes plus raisonnables mais jy voudrois quelles le fussent assez pour ne se point separer de celles qui composent l eglise anglicane particulierement au terme ou nous somme elles devroient tout faire pour une bonne reconciliation dans le conjuncture de affaire presentes il devroient bien sapercevoir quil ny quune bonne reunion qui puisse prevenir le maux dont langleterre est menacee car pour dire la verite je ne voi pa que leue meeting soient de fort grande utilite quon puisse sy consoler davantage que dans le eglises episcopales quand jestois londres il bien tost cinq an je trouvay en plusieurs assemblees particulieres pour voir comme ly prenoit pour linstruction du peuple la predication de la parole de dieu mais javoue que je en receus aucune edification ientendis un de plus fameux nonconformistes il prechoit en vn lieu ou il avoit trois hommes soissante ou quatre vingt emmes il avoit choisi un texte touchant le restablissement de ruines de ierusalem pour lexpliquer il cita cent fois plinie vitruve noublia pa de dire en italien ce proverbe duro con duro non fa muro tout cela parut hors de propos fort peu propos pour de femmelettes tres eloigne dun esprit qui ne cherche que la consolation ledification de s auditeurs se cantonner faire un schisme pour avoir la liberte de debiter de telles vanit est une fort vaise conduite le peuples paroissent bien ibles de quitter leur mutuelles assemblees pour de choses qui ritent peu leur estime leur preference ie nestime pa quon soit en obligation de souffrir ce dereglement il est vray quautrefois souffroit le assemblees de novatiens rome constantinople que le donatistes voient en la premiere place quelque sorte de liberte mais cestoit le estrangers cela meme ne dura pa long temp comme ily en avoit peu cela ne tiroit pa en consequence mais cest un autre fait en angleterre comme le bien de l estat de l eglise depend absolument de lunion du peuple sur le poinct de la religion ny pourroit trop presser une union universelle mais il la faut procurer par le bonnes voyes comme monsieur le eveques sont de personnes dune grande experience dun scavoir extraordinaire dun zele dune bonte envers leur peuples veritablement paternelle jespere quils semployeront c grand rage avec toute la prudence la charite qui nt necess

obedient servant le moyne paris l doctob monseigneur rien ne vous deu paroistre si estrange ny si incivil que mon silence sur la lettre que vous fistes lhonneur de mescrire il environ trois mois il est pourtant vray que je nay rien reprocher sur cela fin que vous le croyiez comme moy vous voulez bien permettre de vous dire comment la chose sest passee quand mapporta vostre lettre jestois retombe dans une grande violente fiebvre dont dieu afflige durant quatre ou cinq mois qui mene jusqua deux doits de la mort ie priay un de me amis qui estoit alors dans chambre de louvrir de dire le nom de celuy qui lescrivoit mais il se trouva que vous aviez oublie de la signer sur quoy je la fis apporter pour voir si je nen connoistrois point le caractere et ce fut encore inutilement par ce que jusqualors je n avois rien veu de vostre main cela fit croire quelle avoit este escrite par celuy la mesme qui lavoit apportee pour mattrapper dix ou douze sou de port car ce petit stratageme est assez commun en cette ville aprez cela je ne mi pa fort en peine de ce quelle deviendroit elle se conserva pourtant dans mon cabinet par le plus grand hazard du monde mestant heureusement tombee sou la main il deux ou trois jours je la relus laiant trouvee trop sage trop grave pour avoir este escrite par un homme tel que je lestois imagine je la monstray monsieur claude qui reconnut dabord vostre escriture qui dit que vous en estiez lauteur ie pense monseigneur que cela suffit pour justifier auprez de vous dun silence qui bien que je nen sois aucunement coupable ne laisse pa de donner quelque espece de confusion mais pour venir au contenu de vostre lettre je ne vous puis exprimer avec quelle douleur japprens que vos division continuent en un temp auquel il de raisons si pressantes de se reunir ce que vous dites sur tout de escrits que lon publie cette heure pour faire croire que la communion avec l eglise anglicane est illegitime que le ministres ne la peuvent permettre aux particuliers sans crime paroist une chose si deraisonnable en elle mesme si fort contretemps que jaurois peine la croire si elle ne mestoit attestee par une personne de vostre merite de vostre poids vous savez bien monseigneur quels sont quels ont toujours este me sentimens sur cela la maniere dont jen uzay il deux an dans mon voiage angleterre en frequentant vos assemblees en preschant mesme dans un troupeau qui est sou la iurisdiction de l eglise anglicane monstre assez que je suis bien eloigne de croire que sa communion soit illegitime et cela mesme prouve dune maniere bien evidente que mon sentiment cet egard est celuy de no eglises parce quil nest pa imaginable que jeusse voulu faire sans necessite une chose qui meust attire lindignation de me freres qui mon retour meust expose leurs reproches ou leurs censure pleust dieu monseigneur que tout ce quil de chrestiens egarez dans le monde voulussent recevoir vostre reformation que je repandrois de bon coeur tout ce que jay de sang pour leur procurer un si grand bien et que je suis asseure de la joye extresme avec laquelle no eglises entreroient dans leur communion si en estant dans la purete de vos sentimens pour le dogmes il ne differoient plus davec nous que par de surplis par de ceremony innocentes par quelque diversite ordres dans le gouvernement de l eglise et cela monseigneur vous fait assez comprendre ce que jay respondre vostre seconde question car puis que l eglise anglicane est une veritable eglise de nostre seigneur puis que son culte s dogmes sont purs nont rien de contraire lu parole de dieu et puis que quand la reformation este receue elle este receue avec lepiscopat et en establissant la liturgie le ceremony qui sont aujourdhuy en uzage il est sans doute du devoir de tous le reformez de vostre royaume de se tenir inseparablement unis cette eglise et ceux qui ne le font pa sou ombre quils desireroient plus de simplicite dans le ceremony moins dinegalite entre le ministres commettent asseurement un tres grand peche car le schisme est le plus redoutable mal qui puisse arriver l eglise et pour leviter la charite chrestienne oblige tous le gen de bien supporter en leurs freres de choses bien moins supportables que ne le doivent paroistre celles dont il sagit aux yeux de ceux la mesmes qui le ont le plus en aversion et cestoit la si bien le sentiment de nostre grand excellent calvin que dans son traitte de la necessite de la reformation il ne fait point de difficulte de dire que sil se trouvoit de gen assez deraisonnables pour refuser la communion dune eglise pure dans son culte dans s dogmes pour ne pa se soumettre avec respect son gouvernement sou ombre quelle auroit retenu l episcopat conditionne comme le vostre il ny auroit point de censure ny de rigueur de discipline quon ne deust exercer contre euxc lv edit amstel om p talem nobis hierarchiam si exhibeant qua sic emineant episcopi ut christo subesse non recusent ut ab illo tanquam ab unico capite pendeant ad ipsum referantur qua sic inter se fraternam societatem colant ut non alio modo quam ejus veritate sint colligati tum vero nullo non anathemate dignos fatear si qui erunt qui non eam revereantur summaque obedientia observent et beze mesme qui napprouvoit pa en general le gouvernement episcopal fait une telle distinction du vostre et est si eloigne de croire que lon puisse ou que lon doive en prendre sujet de se separer de vostre eglise quil prie dieu ardenment quelle puisse toujours de meurer dans lheureux estate ou elle avoit este mise et conservee par le sang par la purete de la foy et par la sage conduite de s excellens evesquesbez contra sarrav ad cap art pag edit fran ann quod si nunc anglicana ecclesia instaurata suorum episcoporum archiepiscoporum authoritate persistat quemadmodum hoc nostra memoria contigit ut ejus ordinis homines non tantum insignes dei martyres sed etiam praestantissimos pastores doctores habuerit fruatur sane ista singulari dei beneficentia quae utinam illi sit perpetua mais monseigneur quoy que le premier auteur de la separation qui vous trouble soient extraordinairement coupables et que ceux qui la continuent et qui la fortifient par leurs escrits de raisonnables et emportez le soient aussy extrem ment est neanmoins certain que dans la multitude qui le suit il une infinite de bonnes gen dont la foy est pure et la piete sincere et qui ne demeurent cloignez de vous que parce que leur simplicite est surprise et quon le effrayez par ce grand mot de tyrannie oppression de supposts de l antechrist dont leur bat perpetuellement le oreilles ie le mets au rang de ce foible qui disoient quils nestoient point du corp et dont st paul dit quils estoient du corp pourtant et il semble que le bons et charitables evesques comme vous en doivent dire quoy quen un sen un peu different ce qu optat de mileve disoit de donatistes de son temp si collegium episcopale nolunt nobiscum habere tamen fratres sunt au nom de dieu donc monseigneur faites tout ce qui vous serum possible pour le ramencr leur devoir par la douceur et par la charite qui seule est capable operer de grandes choses en ce occasion car le hommes qui ont toujeurs de lorgueil se soulevent ordinairement contre tout ce qui leur paroist nagir que par la seule authorite mais il ne manquent presque jamais de se rendre au support et la condescendance mansuetus homo cordis est medicus ie ne pretens pa monseigneur mingerer de vous donner la dessus aucun conseil particulier vous qui voiez le choses de prez et qui avez le coeur tout penetre de la charite chrestienne jugez mieux que personne de remedes qui sont le plus propres un si grand mal et je suis asseure que sil ne falloit pour le guerir que abstenir de quelques expression que quitter quelques ceremony et que changer la couleur de quelques habit vous vous resouariez avec grand pla r et quelque chose de plus difficile il semble sme avoir leu en quelque endroit de vindiciae de monsieur le doien de winsor que ce furent la le sentimens charitables que fit paroistre l eglise anglicane par la bouche de trois ou quatre de s evesques dans une conference qui se fit sur le moiens de reunion en la preniere annee du restablissement de sa majeste britannique et quil ne tint qua quelques ministres de ceux quon appelle presbyteriens que la chose ne passast plus avant quoy quil en soit je prie dieu de tout mon coeur quil ouvre le yeux de un pour leur faire connoistre la foiblesse de raisons sur lesquelles il fondent une separation si affligeante et quil conserve et quil augmente de plus en plus dans le autres la piete le zele et la charite dont il ont besoin pour travailler heureusement une reunion qui rejonira le hommes et le anges et qui attirera mille benediction de la terre et du ciel sur ceux qui auront le plus contribue et je vous avoue monseigneur que je ne servis pa consolable si je voiois quon ne fist pa au moins quelque nouvel effort pour reussir dans un ouvrage si saint et si important dans un temp qui paroist si propre car outre que le interest de vostre estat et de vostre eglise le demandent extraordinairement apprens que par une admirable benediction du ciel toutes vos chaires episcopales sont maintenant remplies par excellens serviteurs de dieu qui aiment iesus christ et son eglise et qui ont tous le qualitez de la teste et du coeur

letter prayed tell assurance humble service would subscribe heart absolutely opinion third letter monsieur claude subject paris novemb stilo novo monseigneur monsieur de l angle mayaut rendu la lettre quil vous plu mecrire jay este surpris dy voir que vous maviez fait lhonneur de men ecrire une autre que je nay point receue laquelle je neusse pa manque de faire reponse vous faites beaucoup dhonneur de vouloir bien que je vous dise pensee sur le different qui vous trouble depuis longtems entre ceux quon appelle episcopaux ceux quon nomme presbyteriens quoy que je men sois deja diver fois explique par de lettres que jay faites sur ce sujet plusieurs personnes dans mon livre mesme de la defense de la reformation ou parlant de la distinction de l evesque du prestre jay dit formellement que je ne blame pa ceux qui lobservent comme une chose fort ancienne que je ne voudrois pa quon sen fist un sujet de querelle dans le lieux ou elle se trouve etablie pag quoy que dailleurs je connoisse assez pour ne pa croire que mon sentiment doive estre fort considere je ne laisseray pa de vous temoigner dans cette occasion comme je feray toujours en toute autre mon estime chretienne mon respect mon obeissance cest ce que je feray dautant plus que je ne vous diray pa simplement pensee particuliere mais le sentiment du general de no eglises premierement donc monseigneur nous somme si fort eloignez de croire quon ne puisse en bonne conscience vivre sou vostre discipline sou vostre gouvernement episcopal que dans nostre pratique ordinaire nous ne faisons nulle difficulte ni de donner no chaires ni de commettre le soin de no troupeaux de ministres receus ordinez par monsieur vos evesques comme il se pourroit justifier par un assez grand nombre dexemples anciens recens depuis peu mr duplessis ordine par monsieur l evesque de lincoln este establi appelle dans une eglise de cette province monsieur wicart que vous monseigneur avez receu au ministere nous fit lhonneur ilnya que quelques mois de prescher charenton ledification universelle detout nostre troupeau ainsi ceux qui nous imputent cet egard de sentimens eloignez de la paix de la concorde chretienne nous font assurement injustice ie dis la paix la concorde chretienne car monseigneur nous croyons que lobligation conserver cette paix cette concorde fraternelle qui fait lunite exterieure de leglise est dune necessite si indispensable que paul na pa fait difficulte de la joindre avec lunite interieure dune mesme foy dune mesme regeneration non seulement comme deux choses qui ne doivent jamais estre separees mais aussi comme deux choses dependantes lune de lautre parce que si lunite exterieure est comme la fille de linterieure elle en est aussi la conservatrice cheminez dit il ephes comme il est convenable la vocation dont vous estes appellez avec toute humilite douceur avec un esprit patient supportant lun lautre en charite estant soigneux de garder lunite de lesprit par la lien de la paix dun cote il fait dependre cette charite fraternelle qui nous joint le un avec le autres de nostre commune vocation de lautre il nous enseigne quun de principaux moyens de conserner en son entier cette commune vocation quil appelle lunite de lesprit est de garder entre nous la paix selon la premiere de ce maximes nous ne pouvons avoir de paix ni de communion ecclesiastique avec ceux qui ont tellement degenere de la vocation chretienne quon ne peut plus reconnoitre en eux une veritable salutaire foy principalement lors qu de erreurs mortelles il ajoutent la tyrannie de lame quils voulent contraindre la conscience en imposant la necessite de croire ce quils croyent de pratiquer ce quils pratiquent car en ce ca le fondement la veritable cause de la communion exterieure nestant plus la communion exterieure cesse aussi de droit ilnyen peut plus avoir de legitime selon la seconde maxime nous ne croyons pa quune simple difference de gouvernement ou de discipline ni mesme un difference de ceremony innocentes de leur nature soient un sujet suffisant pour rompre le sacre lien de la communion cest pourquoy no eglises ont toujours regarde considere la vostre non seulement comme une soeur mais comme une soeur aisuee pour qui nous devon avoir de tendresses accompagnees de respect de veneration pour qui nous presentons sans cesse dieu de voeux tresardens nous nentrons point dans la comparaison de vostre ordre aver celuy sou lequel nous vivons nous savons quilnyen ni nyen peut avoir aucun entre le hommes qui par nostre corruption naturelle ne soit sujet de inconveniens le nostre le siens comme le vostre lun lautre sans doute ayant leurs avantages leurs desavantages diver egards alternis vincut vincuntur il nous suffit de savoir que la mesme providence divine qui par une necessite indispensable par la conjoncture de choses mit au commencement de la reformation no eglises sou celuy du presbyterat mi la vostre sou celuy de l episcopat que comme nous somme assurez que vous ne meprisez point nostre simplicite nous ne devon pa aussi nous elever contre vostre dignite ainsi monseigneur nous desapprouvons entierement voyons avec douleur de certeines extremitez ou se jettent quelques un de part dautre le un regardant l episcopat comme un ordre si absolument necessaire que sans luy ilny peut avoir ni de societe ecclesiastique ni de legitime vocation ni desperance de salut le autres le regardant avec indignation comme un reste antichristianisme ce sont egalement de chaleurs de exces qui ne viennent point de celuy qui nous appelle qui pechent contre le loix de la sagesse de la charite voyla monseigneur no veritables sinceres sentimens communs pour ce qui vous regarde puisque vous desirez que je descende un peu plus particulierement letat ou se trouve vostre propre eglise par le division intestine qui la travaillent permettez moy que je ne vous dise me pensees quen vous expliquant me souhaits le desirs de mon coeur sur une chose aussi importante que lest celle la ie souhaiterois donc de toute mon ame que ceux qui sont allez jusqu ce point que de songer rompre le lien exterieurs la dependance mutuelle de vos troupeaux pour donner chaque eglise particuliere une espece de souveraignte de gouvernement considerassent bien si ce quils pretendent faire nest pa directement contraire lesprit du christianisme qui est un esprit dunion de societe non de division quils considerassent que sou pretexte que le principe de reformez est davoir en horreur la domination humaine sur la foy sur la conscience comme une chose destructive de la religion il ne faut pourtant pa ni rejetter tout frein de discipline ni secouer tout joug de gouvernement ni se priver de secours que nous pouvous tirer de lunion generale pour nous affermir dans la vraye foy dans la vraye piete quils considerassent enfin que la mesme raison qui leur fait desirer l independence de troupeaux peut estre aussi employee pour etablir l independance de personnes dans chaque troupeau car un troupeau na pa plus de droit de vouloir estre independant de autres troupeaux quune personne en auroit de vouloir estre independante de autres personnes ce seroit aneantir toute discipline jetter l eglise entant quen nous seroit dans une horrible confusion exposer lheritage du seigneur lopprobre de s adversary pour ce qui regarde ceux quon appelle parmy vous presbyteriens comme je suis persuade quils ont de la lumiere de la sagesse du zele je souhaiterois aussi de tout mon coeur quils gardassent plus de mesure dans le scandale quils croyent avoir autrefois receu de lordre episcopal quils distinguassent le personnes daves le ministere le personnes qui occupent le charge non seulement ont leurs defauts mais il peut mesme quelquefois arriver que le plus saintes le plus eminentes charge soient possedees par de mechans en ce ca la raison la piete voulent egalement quon ne confonde pa le ministere avec le ministre present que dieu par sa grace ote ce scandale de devant leurs yeux quil leur fait voir dans le personnes de monsieur le evesques de la piete du zele de la fermete pour la conservation de la religion jespere que cela mesme ne contribuera pa peu ladoucissement de esprit dailleurs je souhaiterois quil leur plust de considerer que si dans le gouvernement episcopal ilya de inconveniens facheux comme je ne doute pa quilnyenayt ilyena aussi de tresfacheux dans le presbyterien comme je lay deja dit nul ordre dont lexercice est entre le main de hommes nen est exempt legalite s vice s exces craindre de mesme que la superiorite le plus sur le plus sage nest donc pa de voltiger de lune lautre ni de risquer de faire un ebranlement general sur lesperance destre mieux quand mesme seroit en autorite en pouvoir de le faire la prudence la justice la charite chretienne ne permettent pa den venir ce eclattantes dangereuses extremitez pour une simple difference de gouvernment le plus sur le plus sage est de tacher dapporter quelque temperament pour eviter ou pour diminuer autant quil se peut le inconveniens quon apprehende non de recourir de remedes violens ie ne craindray pa dappeller de ce nom celuy de faire de assemblees part de se separer de assemblees commune de se soustraire de vostre gouvernement ilnya personne qui ne voye que ce seroit un veritable schisme qui en luymesme de sa nature ne peut jamais estre quodieux dieu aux hommes dont le auteur le protecteurs ne sauroient eviter quils ne rendent conte devant le tribunal de nostre commun maitre quand paul nous defendu de delaisser nostre commune assemblee il non seulement condamne ceux qui ne sy trouvent point en demeurant dans leur particulier mais ceux aussi sans doute qui en font dautres opposees aux commune car cest rompre le lien de la charite chretienne qui ne nous joint pa seulement avec quelques un de no freres mais avec tous no freres pour recevoir deux de ledification pour leur en donner de nostre part en vivant ensemble dans une mesme societe el il ne servirot de rien de pretexter que la conscience resiste se trouver dans de assemblees qui se font sou un gouvernement quon napprouve pa que ce seroit approuver exterieurement ce que lon condamne interieurement car outre quil faudroit bien examiner la question si ce resistance ne viennent pa dune conscience trompee par un jugement precipite puisque le plus gen de bien sont souvent sujets se former de tels scrupules qui au fond ne sont pa tout fait legitimes outre cela il faut distinguer trois sortes de choses le unes que la conscience approuve recoit ausquelles elle acquiesce pleinement le autres quelle regarde comme insupportables comme destructives de la gloire de dieu de la vraye foy de la vraye piete de lesperance du salut le autres enfin qui tiennent le milieu cestadire quon napprouve pa la verite pleinement mais quon ne croit pourtant pa mortelles la vraye piete au salut en un mot quon regarde comme de tach de infirmitez supportables iavoue que quand trouve dans de assemblees de choses de ce second ordre ou que la conscience le juge telles ne peut assister toute la question se reduit savoir si lon ne se trompe pa sur quoy il faut bien prendre garde de ne pa faire de jugemens temeraires mais de simaginer quon ne puisse en bonne conscience assister de assemblees que lors quon approuve pleinement generalement toutes choses cest assurement ne pa connoitre ni lusage de la charite ni le loix de la societe chretienne ce principe renverseroit toutes le eglises car je ne say silyen aucune dont le gouvernement la discipline la forme exterieure le usage le pratiques soient dans une telle perfection quilnyayt absolument rien redire quoy quil en soit comme le jugemens de hommes sont fort differens ce seroit ouvrir la porte de separation continuelles abolir le assemblees il est donc constant que la conscience noblige point se soustraire de assemblees mais quau contraire elle nous oblige de nous tenir attachez lors que le choses qui nous choquent sont supportables quelles nempechent pa lefficace salutaire de la parole du culte divin de sacremens et cest la faveur de ce support de la charite quest couverte lassistance que nous donnons de choses que nous napprouvons pa entierement voyez ce que paul dit s philippiens chap si vous sentez quelque chose autrement dieu vous le revelera aussi toutefois cheminons en ce quoy nous somme pervenus dune mesme regle sentons une mesme chose cela est bien eloigue de dire de que vous aurez le moindre sentiment contraire separez vous la conscience ne vous permet pa de demeurer ensemble consilia separationis dit augustin contre parmenian inania sunt perniciosa plus perturbant infirmos bonos quam corrigant animosos malos quels funestes effets ne produiroit pa une telle separation si elle setablissoit au milieu de vous de la maniere que le esprit de hommes sont faits verroit bientot naitre de la la difference de interets celle de party celle de sentimens legard mesme de la societe civile la hayne mutuelle toutes le autres tristes suite que la division qui nest plus temperee par la charite produit naturellement ie laisse part le scandale quen recevroient toutes le eglises reformees de l europe la joye quen auroient leurs adversaires le avantages quils en retireroient qui selon toutes le apparences ne seroient pa petits iay trop bonne opinion de ce monsieur qui croyent que la gouvernement presbyterien est preferable l episcopal pour nestre pa persuade quils font de sage de serieuses reflexion sur toutes ce choses sur tant dautres que leurs lumieres leur fournissent que la conscience lamour de la religion protestante le empechera toujours de rien faire qui puisse estre blame devant dieu devant le hommes car enfin je ne saurois croire quilyenayt aucun parmy eux qui regarde ni vostre episcopat ni vostre discipline ni quelques ceremony que vous observez comme de tach de erreurs capitales qui empechent quon ne puisse faire son salut mesme avec facilite dans vos assemblees sou vostre gouvernement il ne sagit icy ni de lesse ni du bene esse mais seulement du melius esse quils disputent avec vous cela estant ainsi la justice la charite lamour de la paix la prudence le zele pour le general de la religion ne consentiront jamais quils se detachent de vous mais monseigneur puisque vous mavez mi la plume la main sur ce sujet pardonnez je vous supplie liberte si elle va jusqua vous dire ce que je croy que vous aussi devez faire de vostre part iespere donc que dans ce occasion que dieu vous presente vous ferez voir toute la terre en convaincrez le plus incredulez que vous aves de la piete du zele de la crainte de dieu que vous estez de dignes ouvriers de dignes serviteurs de iesus christ cest deja le temoignage que vous rendent le gen de bien que nul quelque mal intentionne quil soit nose contredire je ne doute pa que vous ne poussiez vostre vocation jusquan bout mais outre cela monseigneur jespere que vous ne defaudrez point aux devoir de la charite de lesprit de paix que quand il ne sagria que de quelques temperamens ou de quelques ceremony qui servent dachoppement qui en elles mesmes ne sont rien en comperaison dune entiere reunion de vostre eglise sou vostre saint ministere vous ferez voir que vous aymez lepouse de vostre maitre plus que vous mesmes que ce nest pa tant de vostre grandeur de vostre dignite ecclesiastique que vous desirez tirer vostre gloire vostre joye que de vos vertu pastorale de soins ardens que vous avez de vos troupeaux iespere aussi que ceux que vous avez choisis appellez au ministere ceux que desormais vous appellerez avec un prudent discernement reglez non seulement par la donceur mais aussi par la severite de la discipline quand la severite serum necessaire marcheront sur vos trace suiront heureusement lexemple que vous leur donnerez pour estre euxmesmes en exemple en edification aux eglises qui leur sont commises ie finis monseigneur par de prieres tresardentes que je presente dieu de tout mon coeur afin quil luy plaise de vous conserver jamais le flamebeau de son evangile de repandre sur tout le corp de vostre ministere une abondante mesure de son onction de sa benediction celeste dont celle de lancien aaron nestoit que lombre afin quelle soit non lembleme limage de la concorde fraternelle comme cette ancienne mais quelle en soit la cause le lien ie le prie quil veu lle de plus en plus ramener le coeur de enfans aux peres de peres aux enfans afin que vostre eglise soit heuereuse agreable comme un eden de dieu ie le prie enfin quil vous conserve vous monseigneur en parfait longue sante pour sa gloire pour le bien lavantage de cette grande considerable pertie de son champ quil vous donne cultiver que vous cultivez si heureusement ie vous demande aussi le secours de vos saintes prieres la continuation de lhonneur de vostre affection en vous protestant que je seray toute vie avec tout le respect que je vous doi monseigneur vostre treshumble tresobeissant serviteur
