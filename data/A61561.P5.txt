meer civil allegeance framed wherein expresly denied power pope excommunicate majesty subject case whatsoever direct spiritual affair sure catholick would say oath contain meer civil allegeance though prince whose order framed term oath civil allegeance refusers thereof guilty disloyalty consider secondly whether since manifest oath though styled oath meer civil allegeance may contain thing

may judge oath far contains thing appertaining spiritual ecclesiastical jurisdiction whether since present oath contains thing declared pope may judge oath far contains thing though pretended contains

thence triumph conclude pope power though inference null insinuated produce scripture several instance prove christ apostle power extend self sometimes temporal answer case extraordinary consequently ought brought proof power pope though christ exercised never great temporal power deposed king ever pope depose pretend depose might answer put saying extraordinary case proceeded extraordinary jurisdiction follows another reason great value among impugners pope power depose king cannot found antiquity till gregory vii time one precedent power pope whereas christian persecuted much pagan emperours persecuted heretical prince neither ancient christian le courage zeal religion conservation thereof modern whatever opinion pope power depose king reason solid first ground forementioned power upon prescription agreement made prince easily answer time pagan emperours prescription agreement made consequently wonder time power exercised secondly since deposition put execution help

extraordinary case certainly power different different direct absolute power indirect conditional power onely depose prince former inconsistent sovereignty prince latter direct absolute power easily often many time meer pleasure invested therewith put execution whereas pure indirect power seldome reduced practice extravagant case onely hence deduce indirect power prince attribute pope inconsistent security duty respect due unto certainly one prince may secure another prince yet every prince indirect power depose sovereign case necessary defence subject one walk street may secure take away life yet indirect power kill attaques unjustly cannot otherwise defend self respect due prince catholick divine affirm pope concerning point without therefore charged disrespect toward meer
