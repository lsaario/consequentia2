nullus demonstratio scopo subsit error actum est de globulis cartesianis sed videtur say ingeniosus demonstrator non satis intellexisse scopum quo collinneare debeat ipsius demonstratio answer perceive learned doctor endeavour refute neither understood law reflection refraction according de carte hypothesis neque enim satis erat probare quod agnosco eum fecisse scite eleganter refractiones gutta pluvia ita fieri ut si duobus pellucidi parallelipipedi lateribus oppositis factae essent sed oportebat praeterea evicisse quod eodem modo refringatur radius utrisque locis quo parallelipipedo refringitur hoc est ut radius bc quamvis oblique perpetuo tamen currat versus eandem extremitatem tam f quam parallepipedi puta versus extremitatem e nam hoc casu rotatio ad dissolvitur iterum ad f ut supra dictum est sed demonstratio ingeniosi micrographi huc non attingit sed probat secundam refractionem opposito latere fieri ad modum refractionis parallelipipedo c ubi radius bn primo refringitur procurrens versus extremitatem e ibique inflexus pergit postea versus alteram extremitatem g refringitur f quae refractio non diluit rotationem prioris refractionis quippe quod tendentia radius sit partem oppositam learned doctor better consulted de carte doctrine common law reflection refraction would quite another mind would positively asserted proposition positively contrary principle de

contrary way reflecting superficies contrary experiment must therefore consider find reason colour generated according assertion great refraction doubly promoted rotation made refracting superficies way much promoting said rotation globuli might therefore pleased suspended conclusion adeo ut doctrina cartesiana de globulis eorumque rotationibus nihil periclitetur ab hac demonstratione quae
