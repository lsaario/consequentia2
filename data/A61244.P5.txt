two tap equal bignesse one put bottom vessel upper part manifest time wherein upper part shall issue determinate measure water inferiour part shall issue four five many measure according difference height tap distance upper tap superficies level water vessel alwayes follow though hath said tap equal water discharging keep said tap alwayes full first note although measure tap equal neverthelesse issueth equal time unequal quantity water attentively consider businesse find water lower tap runneth passeth much greater velocity doth upper whatever reason therefore would quantity water discharge upper tap would discharge neather time plain either upper tap must multiplyed sort many tap number placed neather tap shall swift upper upper tap made much bigger nether much beneath shall swift equal

manifest determinate time shall first bore drawn four ell line time second hole shall drawn one ell cord onely first passe twelve ell second shall passe onely three ell short quantity cord shall proportion cord volocity hath velocity therefore desiring compensate tardity second cord maintaining tardity draw second hole much cord first necessary draw second bore four end cord thickness cord second hole proportion thickness cord passeth onely first velocity cord first hole hath reciprocally velocity cod second hole thus clear drawn two hole equal quantity cord equal time unequal velocity necessary thickness four cord shall reciprocal proportion thickness swifter cord velocity swifter cord hath velocity slower verified likewise fluid element water end principal fundamental well

demonstrated first proposition also true diver part river may various different velocity follows necessary consequence river hath lesse velocity shall greater measure part hath greater velocity shall lesse measure sum velocity several part said river shall eternally reciprocall like proportion measure principle fundamental well established current water changeth measure according varying velocity lessening measure velocity encreaseth encreasing measure velocity decreaseth passe consideration many particular accident admirable matter depending sole proposition sense oft repeated might well understood corollarie first hence conclude stream torrent namely stream carry equal quantity water equal time make depth measure river enter unlesse entrance river acquire say better keep velocity velocicities acquired river shall different also measure shall diverse consequently depth demonstrated corollarie ii successively river full constituted ordinarily greater greater velocity hence stream torrent enter river make lesse lesse depth river grows full since also water torrent entered river go acquiring greater greater velocity therefore diminish measure height corollarie iii observe also main river shallow fall gentle rain suddenly much increaseth riseth river already swelled though fall another new violent shower yet increaseth rate proportionably rain fell thing may affirm particularly depend first case river low found also slow therefore little water entereth passeth run little velocity consequently occupieth great measure river augmented new water also made swift causeth great flood water falleth bear lesse measure make depth corollarie iv thing demonstrated manifest also whilst torrent entereth river time ebbe torrent moveth certain velocity ever passing extreamest part wherewith communicateth river part torrent measured shall certain measure river swelling rising also part torrent augment greatnesse measure though torrent instant disimbogue water river swelled consider two mouth torrent one lesse rising greater rising mouth discharge equal quantity water equal time therefore velocity lesser mouth shall greater velocity greater mouth thus torrent shall retarded ordinary course corollarie v operation nature proceedeth another effect worthy consideration course water retarding hath said ultimate part torrent shall happen torrent grow torbid muddy streame retarded degree able carry away minute grain earth compose muddinesse case torrent shall clear away mud carry away sand bottome chanel extream part mouth raised voided sand shall afterwards carried away river abating torrent shall return move primitive velocity corollarie vi whilst demonstrated water hath different measure chanel course according varieth velocity measure water alwayes greater velocity lesser contrary measure lesser velocity greater hence may elegantly render reason usual proverb take heed still water consider self water river part wherein le swift thence called still smooth water shall necessity greater measure part swift therefore ordinarily shall also deep dangerous passenger whence well said take heed still water saying hath since applied thing moral corollarie vii likewise thing demonstrated may concluded windes stop river blowing current retard course ordinary velocity shall necessarily amplifie measure river consequently shall great part cause may say potent concauses making extraordinary inundation river use make certain often strong continual wind shall blow current river shall reduce water river tardity motion time wherein run five mile moveth one river increase five time measure though added quantity water thing indeed hath something strange certain look proportion water velocity winde hath velocity winde sueh reciprocally
