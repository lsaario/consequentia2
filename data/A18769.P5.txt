noueritis quicquid enim sapiente diligenter prouidetur cum ad actum accedit facilius toleratur facilius ergo inquietationem lucij tolerare poterimus si communi studio premeditati fuerimus quibus mofiis eam debilitare instaremus quam non multum timendam nobis esse existimo cum ex irrationabili causa exigat tributum quod ex britannia habere desiderat dicit enim ipsum sibi dare debere quia iulio caesari ceterisque successoribus suis redditum fuerit qui dissidio priscoru britonum inuitatem cum armata manu britaniam applicuerunt atque patriam domesticis motibus vacillante suae potestativi violetia submiserunt quia vero hoc modo eam adepti fuerunt vectigal ex ea iniuste ceperunt nihil enim quod vi vt violentia acquiritur iuste ab ipso possidetur qui violentiam metuit irrationabilem ergo causam pretendit qua no iure sibi tributarios esse arbitratur quoniam ergo id quod iniustu est nobis praesumit exigere consimili ratione petamus ab illo tributum romae qui fortior superuenerit ferat quod habere exoptauit nam si quia caesar caeterique romani reges britanniam olim subiugauerunt vectigal nunc debere sibi ex illa reddi decernit similiter nunc ego censeo quam rom mihi tributum reddere debet quia antecessores mei eam antiquitus obtinuerunt belinus etenim ille britonum serenissimus rex vsus auxilio fratris sui brenni videlicet ducis allobrogum suspensis medio foro viginti nobilioribus romani vrbem ceperut captamque multis temporibus possederunt constantinus etiam helenae filius necnon maximianus vterque mihi cognatione propinquus alter post alterum diademate britanniae

potestati eorum subtrahebamus hoeli regis minoris britanniae responsio licet vnusquisque vestrum totus se reuersus omnia omnibus animo tractare valuerit non existimo eum praestantius consiliu posse

optimi consilij profectum laudare indesinenter debemus nam si iuxta praedicta rationem romam adire volueris non dubito quin triumpho potiamur dum libertatem nostra tueamur dum iuste ab innimicis nostris exigamus quod nobis iniuste petere incaeperunt quicunque enim sua alteri eripere conatur merito quae sua sunt per eum quem impetit amittit quia ergo romani nostra nobis demere affectant sua illis procul dubio auferemus si authoritas nobis congrediendi praestabitur en congressus cunctis britonibus desiderandus vaticinia sibille de britonibus en vaticinia sibyllae quae veris angurijs
