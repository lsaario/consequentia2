fortis whence seemeth plain alkalizate salt existent many vegetable even natural estate made alkalizate lixivial fire quantity salt call said body far different make luctation acid give particular instance several proportion wherein appears several vegetable first vegetable body datestones amongst least apt make luctation acid may said make hence potent nephriticks many stone make sensible luctation ginger make small bullition aq fortis observable glass hence pungency ginger lyeth sulphureous volatile salt yet little alkalizate scurvygrassseed make small bullition aq fortis like ginger doth also seed purslane hence although much certain kind volatile salt ginger scurvygrass purslane yet much alkaly one others colocynthis fruitstones stony cover seed elder white bryony violet others aq fortis make bullition perceivable without glass hence appears great cathartick power colocynthis lyeth alkaly acid making much le bullition vegetable body le cathartick reason likewise best correctors refractors force colocynthis kind alkali particularly vrine riverius hath somewhere observed root pyrethrum aq fortis make bullition huff short time hence cause durable heat upon tongue alkalizate sulphur heat ginger though greater yet abideth nothing near long pellitory pyrethrum said maketh also sensible bullition acid kermesberries commonly ignorantly called said liquor huff equal

blood fat chyle spittle flegm bile c vegetable imitate milk mucilage rosin gum salt mineral imitate vitriol allom salt also metal like say upon good premiss may conclude may done one step also give instance somewhat may done every kind first imitation animal body instance fat may made thus take oyl olive powr upon high spirit nitre digest day degree oyl becomes colour marrow last congealed hardned white fat butter dissolveth fire animal converting oyl thus fat noted hardens upon exhalation sulphureous part spirit nitre effected well enough purpose unstopping glass time digestion suffering oyl dissolve thicken diver time successive heat cold hence true congealing principle spirit nitre separated sulphur better whereof air commodious menstruum said spirit nitre whence also

ordinarily coagulated greater abundance nitrous part received air body reason fat landanimals hard whereas fish soft great part run oyl sc water wherein live instead breath hath nitrous part comparison air hath imitation vegetable body give three instance rosin gum lixivial salt first may made thus take good oyl vitriol drop upon oyl aniseseeds forthwith incorporate together degree harden perfect rosin general defining property truly natural resinous gum least dissoluble water least natural rosin gum yet easily fire also highly inflammable exceeding friable although artificial rosin
