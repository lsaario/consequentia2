first tho certain comet passed earth would raise strong prodigious tide sea surface yet cannot perceive effect would produced abyss supposes dense heavy fluid encompassed side thick solid crust earth

attraction comet could never produced greater effect crust encompassed subterraneous fluid whole earth consisted firm solid matter without abyss certain therefore since tide abyss could crack fissure made earth explain great rain fell earth time deluge mr whiston assumes proposition believe hardly prove viz earth involved comet atmosphere tail acquired prodigious quantity condensed expanded vapour fell surface great part much rarifyd would drawn air afterwards descend violent outragious rain consider incredible velocity vapour descended mr whiston calculates great descended eight hundred sixty
