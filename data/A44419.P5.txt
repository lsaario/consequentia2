generales vehementer contendant rogantur de deputatis hisce synodicorum sententiae quibus ferendis fuit magna admodum varietas multi volebant praesidem eodem quo oeperat pede pergere canonibus dictandis inter exteros isthoc consilium vehementius urgebat scultetus inter provinciales sibrandus sed immodeste imprudenter satis adversus enim illos qui hoc consilii suggesserant fervide admodum de

laborare utpote quibus non tam constaret de ratione ecclesiarum belgicarum quam provincialibus eo demum ferebatur ut praeses politicus itidem praeses ecclesiasticus eum graviter monerent suaderentque

deposceretur southhollandorum suffragium latius est qui historiam pelagianorum scripsit eo quod putaret se collegas suos nomine cursitantium sibrando impetitos fuisse modeste certe suffragio suo

praeses narrat jam tandem post aliquot septimanarum laborem assiduum indulsisse synodo deum consensum illum suavissimum quem omnes tanto opere exoptaverant moram monebat nemini debere esse gravem sed gratam potius quia ut ut fundamentalibus optime inter omnes singulos si patebat judiciis convenerat sperari tamen non poterat ngulos ipsis loquendi formulis conspiraturos monebat porro dictam fuisse hanc sessionem ut delegati omnium singulorum consensum observarent rogantur singuli synodici ut diligenter attendant lectioni articulorum moneant si quid e mutatum velint nec aegre ferant si mute ur

malum omni statu voluntati adesse negamus gratia efficax qua quis convertitur non est irresistibilis ita licet voluntatem afficiat verbo spiritus sui operatione interna deus ut potentiam credendi sive vires supernaturales conferat hominem actu credere faciat tamen potuit homo ex se gratiam istam aspernari non credere eoque etiam sua culpa perire quanquam pro liberrima dei voluntate maximum sit gratiae divinae disparitas tamen spiritus sanctus tantum gratiae omnibus singulis quibus verbum fidei praedicatur consert aut conferre paratus est quantum ad promovendam suis gradibus hominum

convertuntur homo per gratiam spiritus sancti potest plus benefacere quam reipsa facit plus mali omittere quam reipsa omittit nec credimus deum simpliciter nolle ut homo plus boni faciat quam facit mali omittat quam omittit ac ut utrumque ab aeterno sic fiat praecise decrevisse quoscunque deus vocat ad salutem serio vocat hoc est eum sincera minime simulata salvandi voluntate nec eorum assentimur sententiae qui statuunt deum externe quosdam vocare quos interne vocare hoc est vere converso nolit etiam ante rejectam vocationis gratiam non est deo voluntas istiusmodi arcanum quae

ut nonlatin alphabet eorum ostendat non autem ut convertantur credant salventur verum non est ex vi efficacia arcanae voluntatis sen decreti divini omnia non bona tantum sed mala necessario fieri adeo

articulum de perseverantia perseverantia fidelium fide non est effectum illius absoluti decreti quo deus singulares persona nulla conditione obedientiae circumscriptas elegisse dicitur deus vere fideles grantia viribus supernaturalibus instruit quantum ad perseverandum diaboli carnis ac mundi tentationes superandum pro infinita sua sapientia sufficere judicat nec per deum unquam stat quo minus perseverent vere fideles possunt vera fide excidere istiusmodi prolabi pecoata quae cum vera justisicante fide consistere non possint nec potest hoc tantum fieri sed non rare fit vere fideles possunt sua culpa scelera atrocia incidere visdem perseverare mori proinde finaliter excidere perire neque tamen credimus vere fideles etiamsi gravia conscientiam vastantia peccata nonnunquam incidant protinus omni spe resipiscentiae excidere sed fieri posse agnoscimus ut deus fecundum multitudinem misericordiarum suarum co rursus per gratiam suam ad resipiscentiam revocet quinimo non infrequenter id evenisse credimus etiamsi de eo quod hoc certo indubie suturum persuasissimi esse nequeant itaque haec sequentia dogma quae scriptis publicis vulgus sparguntur indie ut pietati bonis moribus noxia toto animo rejicimus viz vere fideles non posse deliberato consilio peccare sed tantum ex ignorantia insirmitate vere fideles per nulla peccata gratia dei excidere posse mille peccata etiam omnia peccata totius mundi electionem irritam facere non posse cui si addatur omnes omnino homines teneri credere se electos esse ad salutem proinde ex electione illa excidere non posse quantam illud securitati carnali fenestram aperiat cogitandum relinquimus fidelibus electis nulla peccata ut ut magna gravia esse possunt imputari quia omnia praesentia futura jam remissa sint vere fideles haereses exitiales atrocissima peccata uti sunt adulteria homicidia prolapsos propter quae ecclesia juxta institutionem christi cogatur testari se ipsos externa sua communione non posse tolerare illos que non habituros partem ullam regno christi nisi convertantur non posse tamen fide totaliter nec finaliter excidere vere fidelis uti pro tempore praesenti de fidei conscientiae suae integritate certus esse
