possibly enquire thee concerning thing determined enquire tell briefly present fundamental thy cabbala proposed aetopaedomelissaean dream cabbal answer shall give one n hast unless thou dost allow defer another time thing amply added three treatise called disquisition exposition mercava cabbalistical catechism compil ask first place whether dost thou deny creation properly called creation according thy hypothesis doctrinal supposition cabb answer paradox paradox becau e perceive thou examinest thing strictly ballance reason part stark blind sublime matter shall answer problematically ye may able judge whether cabbalistical ter also admit another interpretation according dictate reason one may said labour absurdity hypothesis self shall freely expatiate another time therefore answer thy question know one number defineth creation properly calld effection infinite efficient whereby separable constituted made definition active creation may also easily applied passive creation relative respect creator hath creature contrary also creation mediate whether regard efficient regard effect absurdity compil definition dost thou omit call formal reason creation viz done nothing cabb particle ex denote properly belong matter properly belong spirit yet proper subject creation properly called spirit wise said ex another ab another say idaea conception made soul mind soul mind beam ray created spirit made centre unless peradventure regard place centre hand formal member angel appears made angel made compil thus thou seemest shut matter creation cabb creation immediate

effect posterior cause cabbal order nature though order time compil rate spiritual nature differ little creator supposed matter stupefaction dispiritedness follow divine essence kind bodily spirit cabb first place indeed ancient seem asserted soul particle divine air breath men called offspring god act yet warily wisely understood air breath god doth least differ god thing principiated principled differs principle thing agree generically kind doth infer allow essence agree essentially whence none assert divine essence bodilyspiritual deny nature spirit tho perhaps may truly said god may say may called nonlatin alphabet affect moving sufferingly create rather spiits nonlatin alphabet affect moving sufferingly become matter however hypothesis doctrinal supposition nature god established much spiritual vulgar hypothesis vulgar one matter allowed much substance certain extrinsecal accidental modification spiritual substance god vastly distant insomuch wise chief mover thing comp however material world thus sort determined spirit cabb matter spirit substance self appeareth form matter viz blindness darkness wit dull rest privation former happiness sometimes past spirit yet fundamentally radically sometime hereafter formally said rom eph cor example hereof may man living man dead thin vapour ice c comp dost thou therefore conclude positively nothing nothing created cabb indeed positively determined matter made coalition clinging together spiritual degenerate dull monad single being coalition called creation speak accurately say matter made nothing assert spirit produced neither nothing something particle ex respect material cause mean admitted spirit inference first axiom loaded touch hypothesis absurdity incongruity flow vulgar opinion viz matter created god nothing viz supreamly perfect supreamly intelligent supreamly free motion self highest degree supreamly penetrating supreamly immutable supreamly positive supreamly living c produced absolutely imperfect highest degree void science understanding knowledge highest necessity force imaginable bound highest degree law passive motion consequence destitute altogether liberty willing wanting self utmost degree motion subjected motion impression others therefore self highest degree quiet immovable wanting self penetration well active passive highly mutable highly privative despoiled happiness possession real good therefore highly dull sluggish dead consequence enjoying nothing thing contained cause whence also many said nature plainly contrary unto god whereas efficient cause cannot produce thing altogether like unto self neither produce thing altogether unlike unto self yet subject vile void u deservedly said occupy least part universe notwithstanding vulgar hypothesis concluded coextended yea coexisting coordinate god therefore lifted high estimation doctrine whole pagan philosophy exhausted drawn subject alone also established measure theorem maxim conclusion concerning spirit concerning god call demonstration posteriori effect posterior consideration whence becomes accursed materialism consequently atheism done imply contradiction consequent contradiction notbeing speak accurately according law essential description cause manner god must said created death sin shadow darkness monster evil c privation matter privation spiritual nature inasmuch whose definition one positive term ought truly rightly made ingredient neither discerpibility divisibleness separableness allowed abstract considered atome indivisible creation matter nothing doth directly perfectly oppose repugnant wisdom god inasmuch case thus stated might done best example might made every creature spirit yet many would make spirit best contrary goodness would create something without communication good thing contrary beauty matter quite opposite directly contrary distant first fair one yea hereby would progress passage one extream another immediately whence would absurd avoiding uncertain absurdity flow necessarily hypothesis admit many absurdity highly hurtful nature soul kingdom messiah plunge mind material dirty gulphs reason utter blotting spiritual nature length plainly becomes material thing god forbid compil dost thou therefore assert matter cannot created cabb immediately spirit immediately created doth certain assignable cause elsewhere remembered descend state death admitteth quality name matter natural monade single atome mediate creation may made done even dead sinner new creature made messiah therefore third fourth fifth axiomes answer matter considered formally doth exist self truth doth much exist positively privatively doth shaddow rest c whatever spirit whether fundamentally dead man man whether also formally really soul angel god comp therefore dost thou reply rest cabb rest fall every spirit divine essence sixth seventh axiomes seems insinuated numerical identity specifical generical identity hence expresly concluded u nonlatin alphabet systeme separate being comprehendeth briathick jezirathick asiathick isa much product exclude concurrent divinity also exist author emanation existeth according eighth axiome divine essence divided ninth axiome would admit highly adore vnity example limpid clear fountain secretly lurk earthly stony particle length cling grow together separated water man asserts say fountain divided small pebles pebles separated truth creator produced first infinite myriad spirit united supream degree happy perfection messiah still abide god might reason various degree exercise proper freewill come secretion separation made amongst many degree degree knowledge even unto last extremity privation thereof therefore death must time hereafter swallowed isa altho according tenth axiome single particle cannot infinite yet spirit considered self u indefinite amplitude extension great degree knowledge vnion doth admit divine essence self therefore constringed analogous viz created spirit particle material world consisteth cannot said divine essence nature effected constituted produced made created brought outwards divine essence constriction may called sleep according thirteenth axiome death c
