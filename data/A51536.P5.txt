truth told moreover sailed 2 degree beyond pole askt found land island pole told free open sea askt meet great deal ice told saw ice askt weather told fine warm weather amsterdam summer time hot askt question ingaged discourse friend could modesty interrupt longer believe steerman spoke matter fact truth seemd plain honest unaffectatious person one could design upon though believe story yet methinks hear many object apt urge three seeming reason prove false least particular relation first cannot warm pole greenland many part le northerly sea full great body ice ship hardly sail secondly warm yet warm amsterdam summer time farther northerly colder weather thirdly pole could tell come back might well go farther return nearer home needle pointing always north must need lose northpole must indifferently respect point horizon alike one answer may serve first second objection cannot warm northpole c consult experience traveller navigator told tropicks nay equinoctial generally moderate weather england summer time may warm pole amsterdam summer time small height sun hath exception sun summer solstice lesser altitude tropicks must need much colder contradicted one reason warm tropicks tropicks sun remains scarce 12 hour 24 horizon warm remains almost 17 hour 24 horizon therefore leaf greater impression heat upon farther northward go longer remains horizon le horizon every 24 hour till come within arctick circle sun remains half year together viz summer horizon never set therefore though beam perpendicular yet must need cause great degree heat upon horizon argued cold greenland c sea full ice ship hardly sail yet cannot argument prove pole ice made shoars land never open sea come strength current high wind indeed carry small distance shoar relator said pole free open sea c consequently void ice summer time least besides experience tell u landbriezes colder come sea therefore may cold greenland land yet warm pole sea open c third objection pole could tell come
