supplement late treatise called essay discovery new geometrical problem concerning angular section resolving problematically proposed rectification made former essay showing easie method truly geometrical without conick section cubick aequation sect angle arch circle uneven number equal part gk whereas supposed former proposal straight line could drawn extream point three concentrick arch end arch beginning ending upon straight line oming center concentrick arch equal cord though equal arch upon consideration found however seemingly line may appear straight many case radius short angle acute yet case line mathematically straight regular curve regularly drawn true geometrical art parabola conick section greater facility readiness tiro understands nothing conick section cubick equation may way drawing said curve let short crossrule set right angle another longer rule let length cross rule pleasure inch ye mind make length cord part section angle following figure let inch let half crossrule left side long rule let small brass steelpin fixed right end said cross rule rule moved may make impression paper point compass doth drawing circle length longer rule occasion requireth double triple length thus prepared two rule one cutting right angle crossrule fixed though may made also moveable suppose angle given trisected bac measured arch bmc order draw curve line one draught hand set left end crossrule point b b let run slide along line ba run along said line let left side long rule still run center vertical point easily done let run slide along b towards end crossrule reach least line ac one pleaseth brass pin end cross rule shall describe regular curve fig thus drawn curve line distance one half cross rule draw straight line de paralel ac curve line cut straight line de line drawn center shall true geometry trisect given angle bac demonstration seeing property two rule crossing right angle ever two end cross rule terminates make isosceles triangle making always two right angle triangle whose base equal perpendicular common therefore el eucl hypotenusals equal therefore radius ai describing arch hlis draw cord hi let fall perpendicular line ac ik making hiliik therefore arch equal sine equal hlliis qed angle obtruse acute may trisected equal part without curve line part finding point found without curve line letting cross rule slide run along line ab left side long rule still runneth center either upwards downwards right side cross rule touch straight line de shall thus without need noticing regarding curve line point found two straight line hi de meet together thus angle may trisected without drawing curve line may easily truly done without either scale compass two cross rule artist may easily perceive object method mechanical mathematical truly geometrical performed instrument shall refer two great geometrician vindication wit de carte second book geometry franciscus schoten commentary argum lib prove performed instrument geometrically made geometrical otherwise plainest geometry must rejected figure drawn rule compass instrument parabola conick section curve diver curve yea drawn art help instrument devised contend truly geometrical geometrical treatise use diver instrument describing curve geometrically much difficult made difficulty used proposed two simple rule cutting one another right angle seeing hath dependance solid algebra equation may done without curve line showed whose demonstration wholly depends easie proposition first book euclid see may called plain geometry word mechanical used signifie thing mathematically exact coming near approximation sense mechanical mathematical purely geometrical grounded good demonstration proposition euclid corrolary next thing shown quinquisection make one figure serve make cross rule one inch one part middle line setting side one half length cross rule draw paralel line ad let cross rule side along line ab trisection left side long rule slide center end cross rule shall describe curve part shall g h may continued pleasure setting right end cross rule one point let slide move along line da left side long rule runneth center left end cross rule shall describe part another curve meeting h curve found point h radius h describe arch v h z x n shall give v hone fifth whole arch evident foregoing demonstration quinquisection also may made without curve two long rule jointed together like sector moveable cross rule move right angle long rule let center two long rule fixed center let cross rule moved together b left end one still touching right end right end cross nearest line touch upon point w point w shall give quinquisection thus true geometrical line cord may made tiro without conick section algebra equation without table natural sine arithmetical operation whereas euclid hath taught find cord degr also found quinquisecting half circle shewed remains trisect arch degr giveth cord taken leaveth degr bisected give bisected giveth one part circle one quadrant methodical teach beginner make line cord projecting angle sending conick section algebra equation table natural sine capable entry made good progress understand teach ignotum per ignotius unknown thing unknown quite contrary good method true science geometry method quinquisection delivered sufficiently showeth without example section desired corrolaries mentioned former treatise rectification made valid chief shall mention one great use teach beginner make true line cord showed divide circle part required another great use descartes
