perpetua memoria di molti testimoni esaminati forma autentica onde conchiudamente si prouova una publica voce e fama del matrimonio di cui si parla e talvn e charriva deporre davere con glocchi propri veduta laura ricevere dallo stesso duca onori e trattamenti propri di moglie aggeungono ch ella godeva le prerogative che ad una prencipessa solamente potevano convenirsi vegnendo communemente onorata non solo da sudditi anche da prencipi forrestieri ed essendo da tutti chiamata di casa deste cognome del quale intitolava anchella sempre tutte le scritture publiche e private come pure oggi appare per un infinita distrumenti authentici privilegi ordini lettere mandati e simili servivasi del sigillo collarma de prencipi deste ne suoi ordini e lettere parlava noi era solita dandare per la citta con gentilhuomini avanti e dame carrozza dietro per espressione di quella fortuna favorevole che dal umile sua condizione laveva sublimata quello stato di grandezza portava scolpito nella sua carrozza un sole con motto quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est e l duca suo marito alludendo allo stesso fe battere moneta delle quali moltissime si veggono pure oggidi con un salvatore sedere ed una donna suoi piedi colle parole fides tua salvam te fecit segno manifestissimo chl aveva essaltata al supremo grado dimoglie ella dopo la morte del marito vesti per tutto l tempo che sopravisse abiti vedouili e che non auvrebbe fatto se tale non fosse stata daglonori e dalle prerogative chella bebbe vita passono testimoni suddetti alle dimostrazioni che morte le furono fatte e dicono chl duca alfonso secundo el cardinale luigi suo fratello col segnito di tutta la corte laccompagnarono publicamente alla sepoltura onorando il duca quel funerale col corrotto e lcardinale col abito solito portarsi per la morte de parenti la corte tutta vesti da duolo e furono conforme uso esposte larme di detta signora quartate con quelle deprencipi deste vna delle quale riconnosciuta da medesimi testimoni tutta via si conserva onori tale dimostrazioni di questa sorte qual altro potevano competere chad una moglie del duca e come mai alfonso secundo el cardinale luigi prencipi chi nel portamento loro tennero sempre stile e maniere proporzionate alla condizione loro havrebbono tollerato non che cooperato colla propria assistenza che forma somigliante ella fosse tratata quando per una prencipessa della casa loro non lavessero effettivamenti riconnosciuta sonoci finalmente due strumenti autentici e legalizzati che sgombrano ogni nube di difficulta essendo massimamente rogati ferrara luno del e laltro del le precise parole per quello che tocca il punto del matrimonio sono linfrascritte concordi ed uniformi illustrissima dna laura eustochia vxor quondam illustrissimi excellentissimi ducis alphonsi ferrariae mutinae regii ducis c epur viveva di que giorni ercole secundo chi mal affetto come si sa laura ed suoi figlioli non aurebbe permesso ch ella con titoli somiglianti fosse scrittura publica falsamente onorata e con suddetti confrontasi un altro strumento antico che dice illustrissima excellentissima laura estensis relicta quondam illustrissimi excellentissimi principis alphonsi felicis memoriae ducis ferrariae c riflettasi per conchiusionedel presente articolo che qui si tratta di negozio antico nel quale sammettono non solo le pruove conchiudenti le cogietturali e presuntive ancora come sono queste e tanto piu che non si cerca adesso la verita del matrimonio per lo matrimonio stesso solo per legitimare la successione ne posteri nel qual caso tanto piu facilmente si ricevono le pruove le piu leggieri ne di poca considerazione e chel matrimonio suddetto fosse celebrato prima del concilio di trento per che non vi ricercavano tante solennita e le provizioni fatte quella santissima radunanza furono per regolare matrimoni futuri non passati come piu volta da piu supremi tribunali e stato di chiarato ne mancherebbe lo strumento principale del matrimonio del quale fu rogato gio battista sarachi notario ferrarese equesto ed altre scritture concernenti la stessa materia non fossero state tolte dal duca ercole per auversione che teneva come e toccato di sopra duoi alfonsi suoi fratelli cagionata dal essere questi figli dun altra madre e dal vedere che lduca alfonso commun padre glamava con parzialita daffetto ed aveva loro assegnati per cio feudi liberi ed independenti e rendite di non ordinaria conseguenza restanci non dimeno per giudizio divino tant altre pruove ancora che bastano per svelare la verita anzi queste ragioni indotta la maesta di ferdinando secundo imperatore ed informato che alfonso fu veramente legitimato per lo matrimonio susseguito non solo dichiaro vana la fama publicata contrario da persone mal affette concesse anche linvestitura degli stati imperiali non come semplice successore del duca alfonso secundo come prencipe chiamato e compreso nellantiche investiture de miei progenitori e perche non paia che sua maesta senza le dovute precedenti ponderazioni si movesse cio accompagna la sua dichiarazione coll infrascritte formali parole animoque bene deliberato sano maturo accedente consilio restando dunque provato il matrimonio per la fede di tanti storici per la testimonianza dun cosi accreditato giurisconsulto per la deposizione di testimoni per essere stata laura trattata sempre come moglie del duca vita ed morte per titoli sottoscrizioni sigilli arme vestiti e finalmente per dichiarazione dell imperatore vien di necessaria conseguenza abbattuto il pretesto del caso di ferrara perche provato il matrimonio non puo rivocarsi dubbio che figliuoli legitimati per mezzo desso non sieno realmente legitimi e per cio capaci della successione di qual si voglia stato abstract right serene house este
