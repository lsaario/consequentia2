pruove le piu leggieri ne di poca conſiderazione e chel matrimonio ſuddetto foſſe celebrato prima del concilio di trento per che non vi ricercavano tante ſolennitá e le provizioni fatte quella

independenti e rendite di non ordinaria conſeguenza reſtanci non dimeno per giudizio divino tant altre pruove ancora che baſtano per ſvelare la verita anzi queſte ragioni indotta la maeſtà di ferdinando ſecundo imperatore ed informato che alfonſo fu veramente legitimato per lo matrimonio ſuſſeguito non ſolo dichiarò vana la fama publicata contrario da perſone mal affette conceſſe anche linveſtitura degli ſtati imperiali non come ſemplice ſucceſſore del duca alfonſo ſecundo come prencipe chiamato e compreſo nellantiche inveſtiture de miei progenitori e perche non paia che ſua maeſtà
