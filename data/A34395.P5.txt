ought elsewhere must spirit soul part body neither doth proceed sent er demanded whence spirit sent sendeth also spirit specie sent another stand yield adversary therefore philosophy laid strongly conduces refutation hobbesian spinosian philosophy viz kind creature may changed one another lowest may become highest highest considered originally proper nature may become lowest sc according course succession divine wisdom hath ordained one change may succeed another certain order must first turned b turned c must turned c changed c deny consequence viz god creature one substance transmutation creature one specie another stone earth earth grass grass sheep sheep humane flesh humane flesh servile spirit man noblest spirit never progression ascension made unto god chiefest being whose nature still infinitely excels creature placed highest perfection nature god every way unchangeable doth admit least shadow change nature creature changeable s secondly said way objection according philosophy every creature material corporeal yea body matter self hobbs teacheth answer material corporeal also matter body thing far otherwise understood hobbs understood never discovered hobbs carte otherwise dream understand matter body attribute ascribe none certainly following extension impenetrability nevertheless one attribute also may referred figurability mobility suppose distinct attribute certainly profit nothing ever help u understand excellent substance call body matter never proceeded beyond husk shell ever reached kernel touch superficies never discerning centre plainly ignorant noblest excellent attribute substance call body matter understood nothing demanded excellent attribute answer following spirit life light comprehend capacity kind feeling sense knowledge love joy fruition kind power virtue noblest creature even vilest contemptible creature yea dust sand may capable perfection sc various succedaneous transmutation one according natural order thing require long period time consummation although absolute power god pleased could accelerated hastened thing effected one moment wisdom god saw expedient thing proceed natural order course manner fertility fruitfulness hath endued every may appear creature time working still promote greater perfection instrument divine wisdom goodness power operates therein creature hath greater joy possesseth hath fruit labour capacity aforementioned perfection quite distinct attribute life understanding knowledge quite distinct former viz extension figure also vital action plainly distinct local mechanical motion although cannot separated still useth least instrument concourse creature s say life figure distinct attribute one substance one body may transmuted kind figure perfecter figure comprehends imperfect one body may transmuted one degree life another perfect always comprehends inferior example figure triangular prisme first figure right lined solid body whereinto body convertible cube perfecter figure comprehends prisme cube may turned perfect figure come nearer globe another yet nearer ascends one figure imperfect another perfect ad infinitum bound said body cannot changed perfecter figure meaning body consists plain right line always changeable perfecter figure yet never reach perfection globe although always approach nearer unto case diver degree life indeed beginning end creature always capable farther perfecter degree life ad infinitum yet never attain equal god still infinitely perfect creature highest elevation perfection even globe perfect figure unto none approach s thus life figure distinct contrary attribute one substance figure serf operation life see body man beast figure eye serf sight figure ear hearing figure mouth teeth lip tongue serve speech figure hand finger serve work figure foot walk figure member use much conduce vital operation spirit performs member yea figure whole body commodious proper operation human life figure whatsoever could made life figure consist well together one body substance figure instrument life without vital operation performed s likewise local mechanical motion e carrying body place place manner operation distinct action vital operation altho inseparable vital action wise without local motion instrument thereof eye cannot see unless light enter motion stir vital action eye seeing vital operation whole body action life far nobler diviner manner operation local motion yet agree one substance consist well together eye receives light self object seeth without also sends light object spirit life vital action uniting object sight together wherefore hobbs others side grievously erre whilst teach sense knowledge reaction corporeal particle one upon another reaction mean local mechanical motion indeed sense knowledge thing far noble divine local mechanical motion particle whatsoever motion action life us instrument whose service consists herein stir vital action subject percipient like local motion transmitted diver body although far distant asunder therefore united without new transition body matter ex gr beam wood exceeding great length moved one extream north south extream necessarily moved also action transmitted whole beam without particle matter sent hither promote motion one extream beam self sufficient transmit said motion manner also vital action proceed together local motion one thing another great distance apt fit medium transmit may observe kind divine spirituality subtilty every motion every action life created body substance capable viz intrinsecal presence proved agrees created substance yet agrees every motion action whatsoever motion action certain matter substance manner therefore intrinsecally present subject whereof modus manner pas body body great distance find fit medium transmit much stronger motion much farther reacheth stone cast standing water cause motion every way centre circumference forming circle still greater greater great distance much longer time till length vanishes sight without doubt make yet invisible circle longer space time dull sens cannot apprehend motion transmitted centre circumference conveighed thither body substance carrying motion stone external light also seeing action motion stirred illuminate body may transmitted glass chrystal transparent body without substance body matter conveighed illuminate body whence said action proceeded would deny abundance subtile matter continually flow illuminate body whole substance burning candle spent emanation hath motion action call light motion action may increased v g chrystal subtile emanation body may restrained cannot pas least abundance may sufficient communicate whole light seeing chrystal doth easily transmit light hard solid receive many body transmit easily body neither hard solid let resist wood neither hard solid chrystal yet chrystal transparent wood certainly wood porous chrystal le solid consequently light doth enter pore chrystal substance yet adhere make turgescency increase quantity certain intrinseck presence body substance mere action motion chrystal fitter medium receive motion call light wood hence pervades passeth great diversity motion operation body every motion requires proper medium transmit therefore ti manifest motion may transmitted diverse body another kind penetration body matter subtile soever able make wit intrinseck presence mere local mechanical motion certainly vital action nobler kind motion penetrate body passeth intrinseck presence may one moment transmitted one body another rather require time mean motion action self requires least time transmission although ti impossible body wherein motion carried place place ought time either greater lesser according quality body vehemency motion carry therefore see every motion action considered abstract hath wonderful subtilty spirituality beyond created substance whatsoever neither time place limit yet nothing else mode manner created substance viz strength power virtue whereby extendible great substance beyond substance self make may distinguish extension material virtual twofold extension every creature hath material extension matter body substance hath considered without motion action extension speak properly neither greater lesser would still remain virtual extension motion action creature hath whether immediately given god immediately received fellow creature immediately given god also hath natural proper effect essence proper way speaking proper motion creature proceeding innermost part thereof therefore may called internal motion distinguished external another therefore respect thereof may called foreign said external motion endeavour carry body thing place whereunto hath properly natural inclination preternatural violent stone thrown air motion preternatural violent plainly local mechanical way vital doth proceed life thing moved every motion proceeding proper life creature vital call motion life plainly local mechanical hath life vital virtue virtual extension creature either greater lesser according kind degree life wherewith creature endued creature arrives nobler kind degree life doth receive greater power virtue move self transmit vital motion greatest distance motion action may transmitted one body another many matter great debate body substance motion body motion pas properly subject another modus manner consist herein viz exist inherent body answer objection seemeth best motion propagated one body another local motion motion self moved move body motion could propagated local motion motion would propagated another another ad infinitum absurd therefore manner said propagation real production creation god christ create substance thing creature create give substance instrument creature self subordination god instrument may give existence motion vital action motion one creature may produce motion another creature towards moving self fellow creature instrument god motion new substance created new specie thing creature may multiplied kind whilst one act upon move another whole work creature creation instrument god move whose instrument sin punished god said cause sin creature sin abuseth power god hath granted creature culpable god intirely free every spot blemish hereof therefore apply thing already spoken concerning attribute body viz hath quantity figure life also locally mechanically vitally moveable transmit vital action whithersoever pleaseth provided hath medium aptly disposed hath none extend self subtile emanation part fittest proper medium receive transmit vital action hereby easie answer argument whereby endeavour prove body altogether uncapable sense knowledge may easily demonstrated manner certain body may gradually advance perfection capable sense knowledge brute kind perfection whatsoever may happen man angel may able understand word christ stone god able raise child abraham without flying strained metaphor one deny omnipotence god viz god able stone raise child abraham certainly would greatest presumption finis
