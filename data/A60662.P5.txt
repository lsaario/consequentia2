pontani ex theatri chymici excerpta vol pag ego johannes pontanus multas perlustravi regiones ut certum quid de lapide philosophorum agnoscerem quasi totum mundum ambiens deceptores falsos inveni non philosophos semper tamen studens multipliciter dubitans veritatem inveni ii sed cum materiam agnoscerem ducenties erravi antequam veram materiam operationem practicam invenissem iii primo materiae operationes putrefactionis novem mensibus coepi nihil inveni etiam balneo mariae per tempus aliquod posui similiter erravi enimvero calcinationis igne tribus mensibus posui male operatus sum iv omnia distillationum sublimationum genus prout dicunt seu dicere videntur philosophi sicut geber archelaus alij fere omnes tractavi nihil inveni denique subjectum totius artis alchemiae omnibus modis qui excogitandi sunt qui fiunt per fimum balneum cineres alios lgnes multiplicis generis qui tamen philosophorum libris inveniuntur perficere tentavi sed nihil boni reperi v quapropter annis tribus continuis philosophorum libris studui solo praesertim hermete cujus verba breviora totum comprehendunt lapidem licet obscure loquatur de superiore inferiore de coelo terra vi nostrum igitur instrumentum quod materiam ducit esse primo secundo tertio opere non est ignis bal nei neque fimi neque cinerum neque aliorum ignium quos philosophi libris suis posuerunt quis igitur ignis ille est qui totum perficit opus principio usque finem certe philosophi eum celaverunt sed ego pietate motus eum vobis una cum complemento totius operis declarare volo vii lapis ergo philosophorum unus est sed multipli citer nominatur antequam agnoscas erit tibi difficile est enim aqueus aereus igneus terreus phlegmaticus cholericus sanguineus melancholicus est sulphureus est similiter argentum vivum habet multas superfluitates quae per deum vivum convertuntur veram essentiam mediante igne nostro viii et qui aliquid subjecto separat putans id necessarium esse profecto philosophia nihil novit quia superfluum immundum turpe foeculentum tota denique substantia subjecti perficitur corpus spirituale fixum mediante igne nostro et hoc sapientes nunquam revelarunt propterea pauci ad artem perveniunt putantes aliquid tale superfluum immundum debere separari ix nunc oportet elicere proprietates ignis nostri conveniat nostrae materiae secundum eum quem dixi modum scilicet ut transmutetur cum ignis ille non comburat materiam nihil de materia separet non segreget partes puras ab impuris ut dicunt omnes philosophi sed totum subjectum puritatem convertit non sublimat sicut geber suas sublimationes facit similiter arnoldus alij de sublimationibus distillationibus loquentes inque brevi tempore perficit x mineralis est aequales est continuus est non vaporat nisi nimium excitetur de sulphure participat aliunde sumitur quam materia omnia diruit solvat congelat est artificialis ad inveniendum est compendium sine sumptu aliquo saltem parvo xi et ille ignis est cum mediocri ignitione qui cum remisso igne totum opus perficitur simulque omnes debitas sublimationes facit qui gebrum legerent omnes alios philosophos si centum millibus annorum viverent non comprehenderent quia per solam profundam cogitationem ignis ille reperitur tunc vero potest libris comprehendi non prius xii error igitur istius artis est non reperire ignem qui totam materiam convertit verum lapidem philosophorum studeas igitur igni quia si ego hunc primo inve nissem non errassem ducenties practica super materiam xiii propterea non miror si tot tanti ad opus non pervenerunt errant erraverunt errabunt eo quod proprium agens non posuerunt philosophi excepto uno qui artephius nominatur sed pro se loquitur et nisi artephium legissem loqui senfissem nunquam ad complementum oper pervenissem xiv practica vero haec est sumitur diligenter quam fieri potest teratur contritione physica ad ignem dimittatur ignisque proportio sciatur scilicet ut tantum modo excitet materiam brevi tempore ig ni ille absque alia manuum appositione de certo totum opus complebit quia putrefaciet corrumpet generabit perficiet tres faciet apparere colores principales nigrum album rubeum xv et mediante igne nostro multiplicabitur medicina si cum cruda conjungatur materia non solum quantitate sed etiam virtute tot igitur viribus tuum ignem inquirere scias ad scopum pervenies quia totum facit opus est clavis omnium philosophorum quam nunquam revelaverunt sed si bene profunde super praedicta de proprietatibus ignis cogitaveris scies non aliter xvi pietate ergo motus haec scripsi sed ut satisfaciam ignis non transmutatur cum materia quia non est de materia ut supra dixi haec igitur dicere volui prudentesque admonere ne pecunias suas inutiliter consumant sed sciant quid inquirere debeant eo modo ad artis veritatem
