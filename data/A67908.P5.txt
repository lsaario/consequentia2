passage archbishop parker antiquitates britannicae concerning prohibition referred preceding history pag edit londin jamque juris regni periti ut sui commodi causa regia multitudine anno litium infinitate replerent plerasque causa controversias ab archiepiscopali episcopali audientia ad sua judicia vocabant ecclesiasticam jurisdictionem decimarum matrimoniorum testamentorum atque ultimarum voluntatum finibus cancellis concludere volebant quibus etiam saepe ejus potestatem prohibitionibus regiis coercebant impediebant tum illa provisionum statuta brevia de praemunire si praelati ac judices ecclesiastici digitum ut aiunt latum praescriptos se jurisdictionis fine transilirent multis mini vibrabant ea poena praelatis valde terribilis fuit nam si laicis judicibus rei pronuntiarentur bonis omnibus mulctandi aeternis carcerum tenebris involvendi erant hujus poenae atrocitate episcopi praelati jurisdictione praediti ita perplexi perturbati sunt ut quia leguleiorum minantia tela vix vitare poterant anno consilium sine mora ineundem putarunt londini synodo convenerunt ea supplicationem totius anglicani cleri nomine conceptam regi tradiderunt qua de laicis judicibus oppido semperque clericis infestis graviter conquesti sunt nullam esse causam dixerunt cur pro regis regni que incolumitate ac salute major fides consuetudinum quam legum peritis sibi que ecclesiasticae jurisdictionis praelatis haberetur se enim jure certo haerere ac insistere illos arbitrio vagari ac jura pro causis quotidianis quotidiana suo aeri insculpere eadem que causis eisdem figere tollere ac refigere tum quod aliis statutis parliamenti authoritate edantur quo quidem jure nescitur interpretationem sibi peculiariter arrogare leges condentium intentiones que mentes quae sola lex omnibus humanis legibus imperitat incertis motivis decretis impudenter imperite quocun que vellent deducere non esse autem aliam regi causam cur praelatorum fides sibi dubium veniret quam quod prioribus seculis clerus rege defecit romano pontifici adhaesit nunc autem eadem ista lata jura quae praelatis ipsis parliamento contra romanum pontificem deprecantibus pro jure regio sancita sunt praelatos regni iniqua juridicorum leguleiorum calumnia censura que torqueri id quod ex uno inani verbo ab aliquo litigioso calumniatore perperam interpretato perspici facile possit nam lex disertis verbis sancita est anno rich cap purchase pursue purchased pursued court rome elsewhere translation process sentence excommunication bull instrument thing touch king regality realm c si quis impetret aut persequatur seu impetrari vel persequi procuret curia romana seu alibi aliquas ejusmodi translationes processus sententias excommunicationum bulla instrumenta vel aliam rem quamcunque quae regem tangat contra eum ejus regalem dignitatem vel regnum ex verbis causidici qui praelatos sanctionum periculis involvere vellent cavillantur hac tam gravi poena ecclesiasticos judices teneri si quantulumcunque jurisdictionem aut quovismodo titubaverint quo terrore proposito perdifficilis periculosa erit ecclesiasticae jurisdictionis tam arctis coercitae sinibus tractatio quod eo est quia statutum illud praelatorum gratiam latum est cum enim indignissimi antea quique ad papam promiscue confugissent ab eo que nummis intervenientibus opulentissima beneficia maximas dignitates ecclesiasticas impetrassent nec praelati ea ambitione cupiditate romana impediti ecclesias quarum essent patron libere conferre poterant proscriptione sancitum est ne regis deinceps subditi provisiones papa peterent aut citationes processus excommunicationes vel ecclesiasticas censuras papa romae seu alibi ratione hujusmodi provisionum decretas interpositas aut fulminatas anglia vel alibi contra regem aut regis subditos exequeretur denunciaret aut promulgaret quod verbum alibi calumniosi legulei malitiosa interpretatione convertunt praelatos ejusque sensum esse call de fingunt si de causa civili non modo romae sed ecclesiasticis foris consisto ijs quae curia christianitatis appellant etiam regno li forte interveniat longe alium fuisse illorum sensum quorum consensu conditum tum statutum fuit certum est qui illud verbum curia romana vel alibi interposuerunt quia papa ipse saepe ab urbe romana lugduni pisis avinione aliis que locis rom longe lateque disjunctis abfuit quibus illa jura non minus quam romae usurpavit tum papae eadem ipso papae nomine frequenter facere quibus perinde illa saluberrima sanctione occurrendum fuit quam quae romae siunt itaque contra omnem juris aequitatis rationem esse ut quae salubriter praelatorum utilitatem constituta sunt iniquissimis interpretantium cavillis eorum perniciem torqueantur praeterea quis existimare queat tam insanos tum fuisse episcopos ut tam duris saevis si modo ita accipiantur se legibus vellent consentire nam si causa forte civiles suis foris tractent pedem que regis jurisdictionem intulerint eadem poena afficiendi censerentur qua papae provisores etenim omni aequo rationabili jure convenit esse delicto parem itaque si jurisdictionis sibi sine exeant non ipso jure tam graf poenas incurrant sed prohibitionibus coerceantur quas si contempserint vindicentur de contemptu legum enim poenas verborum ambiguitate ad casus non expressos nullo jure referendas sed si verbum ullum condenda lege ambiguum interveniat etiam si de condentium mente non appareat tamen id benigniorem significationem interpretatione deducendum ad extremum addiderunt inique secum agi quod laicorum judicum qui ut ecclesiastica jurisd ctio pen tus contemptui vulgo siat quidlibet statuere vellent tanquam inimicorum censuras judicia patiantur summa petitionis hujus fuit ut parliamenti interpretatione illa vox alibi quae tam perplexam difficultatem induxit declaretur tum ut ecclesiastici judices nisi prohibitiones regias spreverint tam atroci contra provisores poena non teneantur postremo ut hi qui de jurisdictionis finibus totis viribus contra praelatos tam hostiliter semper dimicare solent concedendis prohibitionibus cognoscendis hujusmodi causis exercendis que ecclesiasticos judices judiciis supersedeant alijque statuantur qui cum de jurisdictionis utriusque finibus agatur aut illae causae controversiam venirent sine omni suspicione interpretari controversa jura aequius sine invidia judicare rectius velint hac autem polidorus virgilius falsus est quod martinum papam qui diu lib xix ante obijt cum henrico sexto rege de rescindendis illis juribus actionibus egisse illa statuta quae contra papae provisiones lata sunt poenis provisis praemonitis nuncupata esse scribat sed ut omisso peregrino nostrae historiae sensu veritate que aliena ad hanc praesulum atque praelatorum supplicationem revertamur si tum cum papa authoritatem regiam omni jurisdictione exerceret cumque vi ejus etiam regibus esset formidabilis tamen contra tam immanem violentam juris regni peritorum interpretationem deprecari praelati coacti sunt quid nunc facient cum ecclesiasticae jurisdictionis gubernaculis principi delatis papali usurpatione exclusa nec illa causidicorum turba neque quisquam hominum ordo majore fide religione doctrina prudentia facundia papalem oppugnent principis jurisdictionem tueantur quam praelati vt graviori supplicio digni sint hi qui ecclesiastica judicia jam contra papam eaque principis nomine exercitata obsoletis illorum statuorum calumnijs nunc impediant praelatos munere suo pie recte que gerendo deterreant quam qui priscis illis temporibus papales provisiones romae vel alibi impetrarent quod si tam iniqui calumniatores duriores esse volunt vetera ob alias causa lata jura non ad principis aut reipublicae sed ad suam utilitatem atque quaestum ad
