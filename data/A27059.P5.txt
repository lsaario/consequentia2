patris oportet ut filius ipse peccatum illud se habeat alioqui haec loca inter se non convenirent peccatum ita que sua natura ita factum est ut non tantum animum hominis vastet verum etiam corpus carnem membra depravet ita que paulus ad corinthios ait corporae nostra templa esse spiritus sancti graviter comminatur si quis templum dei destruat si ergo deus puniat peccata parentum siliis filius alienam iniquitatem non portat sed tantum suam sequitur parvulos impiorum hominum cum affliguntur ut patres illis puniantur aliquid se habere paternae pravitatis ne que hic cuiquam conquerendum est de justitia dei nam si deus incorruptissima sua justitia potest eos qui peccant reprobum sensum tradere peccata peccatis punire cur non etiam juste velit peccati corruptionem non tantum animum perdere sed etiam ejus impuritatem corpus quo que redundare vnde qui generantur ex peccatoribus talem naturam ex illis contrahunt qualem illis reperiunt que hac sententia homines admonentur ut sancte vivant

parentibus contrabitur respondemus propagationem originalis peccati esse perpetuam quemadmodum sacrae literae docent aliorum vero peccatorum continuationem non esse necessariam aliquando enim proximis parentibus nihil vitii transmittitur ad liberos excepto peccato originis videtur enim deus modum praefixisse ne malum grassetur immensum hanc mali propagationem suspenderequare quod ad hanc rem attinet libenter assentior augustino probabile esse scripturis consentaneum istam que sententiam martinus bucerus vir doctissimus juxta que sanctissimus probavit vitia privata filios propagari
