ceux qui disent la même chose et aujourdui monseigneur l archevêque de bourdeaux fait faire le proces pour avoir expliqué à l epargne le jour de vendredi saint que nous adorions jesus christ crueifié en presence de la croix que nous n adorions rien de ce que nous voyons et parce que le curé dit sur le champ assez haut le bois le bois j ajoutai non non cest jesus christ non pa le bois et comme il ajouta ecce lignum venite adoremus je le relevai en luy disant auquel le salut du monde eté ataché venez adorons ce salut de monde j ajoutai que le sentiment de l eglise etoit que si par impossible nous pouvions separer la divinité du fils de dieu davec son humanité nous n adorerions pa l humanité puis quil est certain quil ny rien adorable que dieu qu ainsi nous devions nous persuader que nous allions au calvaire adorer jesus christ sans nous arreter au crucifix que l eglise comme une bonne mere nous lavoit donné par une sainte invention pour aider à nôtre foi pour fraper plus vivement nôtre imagination non pour etre l objet de nôtre culte qui se termine à jesus christ voila monseigneur tout mon crime ce que lon reproche jai ecrit au promoteur au vicaire general à monseigneur

opprimer qu elle daigne interposer la sienne pour obtenir la liberté de defendre elle voit combien l honneur de dieu est interessé dans un tems ou toute la province est remplie de missionaires de capucins de jesuites ignorans qui prechent l adoration de la croix la font faire dans une province ou tout est remplie de religionaires ou jose promettre 10000 conversion si la religion etoit
