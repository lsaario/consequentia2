consentiat vel staphyleum de aliis vero neminem admittetis nec tamen pontifici aperietis vos ne id faciatis habere mandatis sed superius enarratas causa vestram excusationem allegantes omnino ut vobis

posse haec omnia eos celare qui huic rei forsan voluerint refragari omnino decreverit aliquos cardinales vel officiarios istius causae participes facere omnem tunc industriam statim adhibebitis ut

regiae excellentiae cui omnia se debere fatetur nunc habuit mecum longum de hac colloquium ut inveniatur modus omnia bene firme secure faciendi quo facto tueri possit ideo que consulere voluit judicium cardinalis sanctorum quatuor symonettae qui excellentior doctior auditor rotae est cum quibus sub sigillo confessionis egit ut ex eorum consilio inveniatur modus ad moram tollendam causam secure peragendam que ita pontifex cum illis hoc quod sequitur se revolvit videtur que optimus verus securus modus rogavit ut nullo pacto dicam hoc obtinuisse ab ejus sanctitate sicuti revera obtinui nam caesariani eum statum pro suspecto allegarent sed quod dicam habuisse cardinali sanctorum quatuor dicto auditore dicunt quod rex deberet committere istic causam cardinali ratione commissionis quam attulit secretarius vel propria authoritate legationis quod facere potest ubi causa fuerit commissa si rex conscientiam suam persentiat coram deo exoneratam quod recte possit facere quod quaerit quia nullus doctor mundo est qui de hac melius decernere possit quam ipse rex ita que si hoc se resolverit ut pontifex credit statim causam committat aliam uxorem ducat litem sequatur mittatur publice pro legato qui consistorialiter mittetur ita enim maxime expediret nam cardinalis sanctorum quatuor symonetta dicunt hoc certum esse quod si regina citetur illa nihil volet respondere nisi quod protestabitur locum judices suspectos esse caesariani petent pontifice per viam signaturae justitiae inhibitionem qua rex aliam nullam possit uxorem capere si capiat prole non sit legitima donec causa non definiatur petent commissionem qua causa audiatur curia de inhibitione vero pontifex non potest negare ne que commissionem nisi injustitia mera vi inferatur adversus quam omnis mundus exclamaret quod si rex aliam uxorem ceperit hoc non possunt petere si petant negabit pontifex quod jure possit nec aliud dicere poterunt vel allegare nisi quod cardinalis eboracen cardinalis mittendus locus sit suspectus petere quod causa videatur hic quo si deducatur statim feretur sententia quam pontifex maturabit non servatis terminis propter momentum negotii alias rationes quas sciet pontifex adducere ita hic obtinebuntur sententiae quae per totum orbem approbabuntur quibus nullus hispanus aut germanus poterit contradicere mittentur angliam declarandae per cardinales prout rex voluerit hoc etiam non obstante pontifex mittet cardinalem tandem hic est modus rebus omnibus secure medendi ad quem sequendum vos pontifex hortatur rogat ut nihil dicatur quod ab eo procedat iste modus non videtur inutilis quia hic auditor asserit non aliter esse faciendum si bene volumus quia reverendissimus cardinalis dominus eboracen instat pro celeritate interim accersiri poterit qualiscun que legatus rex voluerit magi satisfiet vulgo mittendo legato veluti ad definiendam causam hic etiam ut dixi omnia sient quae super id rex petierit praeter pontifex id quod fecit ut resolverem ad literas scribendum contentus est mittere quemcun que cardinalem ego petiero sed ait oportere ut aliquis mittatur habilis id est doctor jure vel theologia qui sunt isti campegius caesarinus senensis cesis araceli monte qui senex est immobilis caesis obsidem ivit neapolim caesarinus episcopatum habet hispania araceli podagra laborat frater est senensis est imperialis non valde prudens campegius esset maxime ad

intra octo dy caesariani cogentur sibi consulere ut eant regnum si dominus lautrek progrediatur vel ibunt senas per iter florentiae tunc campegius poterit exire si rex ita jusserit statim accingetur itineri pontifex jussit ut scribam quod nunquam ingenio aut studio erit excogitando ut adimpleat desiderium voluntatem regis quod solum ista proponit pro meliori securitate ne ista fiant quae postea referri debeant quod pareret dilationem difficultatem quantum ego possim conjicere pontifex exoptat satisfacere regiae voluntati pontifex denuo replicavit quod se totum rejicit brachium regiae majestatis quod certus est quod caesar nunquam hoc illi ignoscet quod ex hac occasione vocabit eum ad concilium vel nihil aliud quaeret nisi ut eum omni statu vita privet dictum sanctitas parvam spem habet gallis nisi quantum operabitur per regiam majestatem reverendissimum dominum eboracen ad quod respondi illum ex praeteritis praesentibus posse judicare futura tandem affirmo quod si semel

secretissimis ac juramento addactis consiliariis ostendisse tum quassans caput scio inquit quid de ea facere constituant verum nondum campegii literas ex anglia legi quapropter die crastino ad redibitis hoc pacto n primo die dimisit ad fuit sermonibus dominus vincentius cassalius quem ob equitem fratrem huc missum dixi qui equitem ipsum excusavit quod quamvis ille animadverteret negotium hoc tanti momenti esse ut etiam cum vitae discrimine romam per dispositos equos sibi properandum esse videret nihilominus supersedisse videns quod si id fecisset necesse sibi futurum domi lectulo permanere potius quam de tanta coram ejus sanctitate agere atque interim dominus vincentius multas rationes ad persuadendum equitis cassalii nomine adhibuit quas eodem pacto ejus sanctitas sequentem diem rejecit postridie ejus diei signatura habita est cui ego tanquam referendarius interfui vesperum que est protracta nec judicavi opportunum pontificem signaturae munere defessum aggredi quum praesertim ejus sanctitas diceret se nondum campegii literas perlegisse re igitur iterum diem proximum rejecta fuit quo postea horam commodam nactus pontificem adivi quum que omnium capitum quae v reverendissimae literis continebantur quasi summam effecissem ne quicquam per oblivionem praeterirem ab ea primum parte coepi qua dicitur suam sanctitatem concessisse commissionem generalem amplissima forma promisisse ferendam sententiam se ratificaturum pontifex hoc verum esse affirmavit dicens se contentum esse ut ad sententiam procedatur qua vero parte est ejus sanctitatem bullam decretalem concessisse ut secretiores regiae majestatis consiliarios instrueret id veritate longe remotum dixit posse que ad id se literas v reverendissimae ostendere atque ea repetivit quae priore die super hoc dixerat viz dominum stephanum gardinerum equitem cassalium se testis habere hanc bullam non ea conditione petitam fuisse ut ostenderetur cuiquam praeterquam serenissimo regi v reverendissimae campegium nunc ad se scribere tantundem effecisse quo facto ex conventione bullam comburi debere promissurum quo que se dixit ut si quae allegantur probentur ad sententiam ferendam procedatur se id ratum habiturum quum que ego quaesissem vellet quae fierent per eam bullam comprobare minime id oportere dixit negavit quo que eam consiliariis ostendendam esse qui tametsi rem bonam non judicarent approbarent tamen super ejus sanctitatis conscientiam ac saepius interim repetivit non esse amplius ea commorandum ad aliam igitur partem deveni qua v reverendissima dicit reverendissimum campegium divortium inter regem serenissimum reginam conatum dissuadere tum pontifex campegium scribere dixit eo se etiam functurum officio ut reginae divortium persuaderet quam ab eo alienam invenerit modeste tamen eam ait locutam fuisse consiliarios petiisse qui ex hispania denegati fuerint ex flandria autem concessi dixit etiam n se literas ad regem reverendissimo campegio ex suo chirographo dedisse ut regia majestas fidem haberet quae reverendissimus campegius suae sanctitatis nomine diceret ad illam deinde partem deveni ubi est causam regis perinde differt ac si nolit ad judicium sententiam que partem suae majestatis ferendam descendere donec n certiorem prius effecerit de ad hanc causam concernentibus quae ibi vidit audivit ad haec respondit campegium quandocun que requisitus fuerit

vult ut mihi suo collegae commissionem hanc decretalem credat dixit verum id esse ideo factum ne pluribus palam fieret eaque conditione qua petitum fuit ostensam nequicquam amplius expectandum ea repetens quae prius etiam circa hoc dixerat ego videat sanctitas vestra quod ex verbis quae hic scripta sunt loquor quae dicunt sanctitatem vestram commissionem decretalem concessisse ea conditione ut aliquibus regiis consiliariis ostenderetur tum pontifex ite rum excandescens ostendam inquit literas ipsius reverendissimi eboracen nec loquor mendacia non minus mei verbis literis que prioribus reverendissimi eboracen fides est habenda quam quas nunc affertis tum ejus sa nctitatem mitigari quaesivi si minus urgenter mandata exequerer quo niam id fieri oportet quod ad regni ruinas damna calamitates scandala diminutionem religionis multa eandem sententiam dixit quam primo die locutus fuit quum diceret egregium vero decus serenissimo huic regi fuerit si ipse qui fidei defensor sit appelletur qui libros etiam pro ejus defensione ediderit eandem nunc impugnare cogatur ad haec quam recte sint venturi viderint ipsi eo autem loco quo dicebatur aliquid de regio negotio inter generalem fatrum de observantia ejus sanctitatem convenisse eo autore foedus inter ejus sanctitatem caesarianos componendum dixit id ostendere quod de regio negotio nihil promiserit quod quicun que pollicitus sit quin poterit habita ratione suae conscientiae ipsa praestare velit eo autem quod de pace tractanda affertur dixit se nullum modum talus negotio invenire ne que se adhuc scire quod iste generalis ullas pacis conditiones sit allaturus que ea insuper addidit quae mei literis die novemb datis v reverendissimae significavi aliis deinde diebus n saepissime sum alloquutus qui decrevit cum reverendissimis de monte sanctorum quatuor cardinalibus de rebus omnibus loqui praeterquam de bulla decretali de qua cum nemine vult ullam fieri mentionem jussit que ex omni scriptura ejus memoriam eximi de reliquis ita que rebus omnibus loquutus sum cum duobus cardinalibus qui dixerunt pontificem contentum fore ut ad sententiam procedatur tametsi id pleris que alienum videatur deque eo nonnulli

otiosum nactus essem multa cum ejus sanctitate de rebus praeteritis disserui deque eo quod ego ad ejus utilitatem cum venetis egissem quoniam scirem serenissimi regis v reverendissimae voluntatem esse ut quotiescun que occasio daretur pro suae sanctitatis commodo omnia fierent exposui deinde quantopere elaborassem pro negotio cerviae ravennae ut que multa gallici oratores egissent v reverendissima potissimum instigati addidi etiam efficacissima verba quibus usus est dominus stephanus gardinerus ad omnia n respondit se ea de regiae majestati ac v reverendissimae gratias habere mihi quoque

afficeretur ab eo caeteri confoederati injuriam propulsarent quod multo magi pro faciendum erat quum qui ipso foedere essent mihi injuriarentur et inde caesariani volunt mihi persuadere veneto non fuisse id facturos si putassent regi angliae aut christianissimo displiciturum neque interim desistunt multa magna que mihi polliceri unde ego quod alias etiam dixi id quod affertur quum aliter facere nequeam accipere cogar illud que etiam vos scire volo promissum mihi fuisse si legatus hic angliam mitteretur futurum ut mihi civitates venetis restituerentur tum ego non omnia beatissime pater adhuc

de ipsa serenissimo regi sit conquerendum ex hac occasione iterum ad regiam causam redii ejus sanctitas dixit se omnia quae potuisset pro regia majestate v reverendissima fecisse facturam que etiam libenter nonne igitur inquam posset ratio aliqua inveniri qua concederetur eam bullam aliquibus ex secretioribus consiliariis ostendi posse tum pontifex non inquit non potest hoc fieri nec impetrari

hujusmodi loqui nolui ego unquam dicere equitem fratrem brevi esse venturum ne pontifex rem illius adventum protraheret ea tantum de causa ut moram interponeret omnibus deinde aliis diebus super eodem negotio institi nunquam tamen pontifex sententiam suam ulla ex parte immutare voluit tantum illud decrevit nuntium mittere velle qui suam sententiam verbis explicaret quum que nulla mihi amplius spes relinqueretur quicquam amplius impetrandi tum demum dixi equitem fratrem romae futurum sequenti die qui quum adeo gravis momenti rem cerneret noluerit suae valetudini consulere quod minime putasset suae servitutis ejus sanctitatem merita hoc modo male tractanda fuisse gratum sibi dixit pontifex equitis adventum fore quod que cum ipso constituerentur omnia negans tamen se ullo pacto id quod nunc petitur concessurum venit ita que eques frater qui non secus ac si nunquam quisquam de hac cum pontifice egisset singula de integro tractavit omnibus modis rationibus tentatis quae excogitari poterunt

pertinere ut gradibus divina lege prohibitis dispensare possit non opinionibus scripturientium qui pontificis authoritatem imminutam velint sed ipsius pontificis sententia constat quem suae jurisdictionis modum optime novisse ampliare velle potius quam restringere credendum est quae quum ita sint etiam si humani juris prohibitio per dispensationem sublata videatur manet nihilominus immotum quod divinum est si ipsis contra seipsos credimus pontificibus deinde ut posse pontifex dispensare fateamur ea parte tribuamus plus authoritatis quam ipsi sibiipsis audeant arrogare tamen non passim non quocun que modo non temere sine omni consideratione posse eos dispensare que fatendum est ne suo testimonio dissipatores verius quam dispensatores appellentur itaque ut causam urgentissimam

nec hujus regni firmandi ratio diutius haberi potest omni suasionis genere horum animis prius adhibito ut alterius voluntati alter cederet eique morem gererent cum nihil profecerimus ad judicii institutionem accedentes de modo causam ipsam pertractandi multa longioribus colloquiis inter no commentati sumus qua dum quae necessaria sunt adornantur exhibitum est per reginam exemplum brevis julii eodem tempore quo bulla super hac materia dati scripti sed attentiore cura longe consideratiore mente confecti quod quia substantialibus etiam ab ipsa bulla diversum est non modo regium sed nostrum quo que animum mire suspensum habuit u que adeo ut de ejus veritate plurimum suspicari libeat nam praeter insperatam tanta opportunitate ejus apparitionem incredibile videtur ut eodem tempore idem author eisdem partibus eadem causa diversa admodum ratione caverit permansuro diplomati ejus que decreto ad perpetuam rei memoriam proferendo plumbeo caractere excudendo dormitaverit brevioribus vero literis molli cera communiendis exactissimi studii sobriae cogitationis speciem impresserit ne tamen majestas haec rem hanc damnatam priusquam exploratam habeat quippe quae magi veritate quam voto suo causae hujus eventum susceptura videtur ad ipsius brevis exhibitionem instat quod quia honestum rationi consonum videtur nobis etiam probatur propterea omni studio curamus ut breve ipsum quod hispaniis esse dicitur quo exemplum hoc effigiatum aiunt proferatur atque ut hoc expeditiore cura ore compendio assequamur praeter primam summam illam de causa cognoscendi potestatem quam sanctitate vestra habemus aliam quoque ad hunc specialiter articulum habendam putamus per quam possimus etiam per censuras omnes etiam regia imperiali authoritate fulgentes monere adigere ut dictum breve nobis exhibeant sine quo causa haec nedum absolvi sed nec commode tractari queat atque hoc primum est quod majestas haec tanta animi fluctuatione qua nunc aestuat nobis curandum putat quo impetrato judicii via insistenres ad causae cognitionem procedemus quod si non proferatur velinutile vitiatum fide sua facile rejiciendum prolatum fuerit nihil prohibebit hoc sublato obice quin ex officio nostro reliqua prosequamur sin vero exhibeatur veritate sua vel adeo scite con icta fallacia ita se tueatur ut acriori examine id inquiri debeat patefacto jam patronorum cavillis calumniis foro quibus undis judicii fluctibus non solum articulum hunc brevis sed universam causam implicaturi simus nullus non viderit neque enim deerunt quae suspectam ipsius brevis fidem faciant vel ex hoc maxime quod cum maxime regis regni hujus intersit nihil prorsus de eo antehac auditum fuerit nec ejus memoria aut ratio ulla extet scriniis regiis quibus etiam minimum quaeque ad regnum spectantia asservari solent nam verisimile non est hispaniis majorem anglicae rei curam fuisse quam ipsa anglia ne que quempiam solerti acri adeo ingenio fuisse qui hujuscemodi dissidium vigesimo quinto ab hinc anno suboriturum hac sola ratione sublatum iri posse divinaverit nulla ut diximus apud hunc regem hoc regno talis rei memoria extante porro si ex brevi ad bullam ex bulla ad breve transitus fiat atque illius jejunitatem ariditatem insectemur hujus praegnantia verba ad omnes fere exceptiones tollendas superstitiosam quodammodo vigilantiam conferamus quae utrin que deduci poterunt rescriptis apostolicis aequo animo audiamus periclitaturi certe sumus ne quod minime cupimus sedis apostolicae authoritatem patientia nostra discrimen rapiamus atque dum regno regi hinc suppetias ferre volumus rem dignitatem que nostram multo minorem faciamus cui tum posita etiam anima favere adesse semper cupimus debemus propterea beatissime pater non solum pro regis causae hujus commodo sed pro dignitate quo que ecclesiastica sanctitatis vestrae autoritate hic tuenda conservanda nullo pacto committendum ducimus ut nobis spectantibus audientibus de potestate romani pontificis de literarum apostolicarum sub plumbo sub annulo scriptarum fide repugnantia deque juris divini abrogatione disceptetur maxime regum causa oppugnanda defendenda qui ut sublimiore sunt fastigio collocati ita iniquiori animo patiuntur causae suae casum cum qua dignitatem existimationem suam diminutam iri intelligunt quae si ignobilium etiam animos quos que exulcerare ipsa rerum experientia docti cernimus qualiter quaeso putamus regios generosos affectura ita que quoniam hanc carybdim ho scopulos evitasse semper tutum erit propterea hujusmodi incommoda quodammodo praetervecti ubi ad litis molestias incertas fori fluctuationes causam deducendam perspicimus suadere rogare summis precibus pari que reverentia contendere non desinemus ut si exhibito brevi pura veritas ita latitaverit quod rectumne falsum vitiatum ceu adulterinum fuerit judicare ac decernere minime valeamus sanctitas vestra causam hanc ad se avocet non solum ut tanto discrimine perplexitate no eximat sed ut paterno affectu causae regi huic optimo subveniat opem ferat atque ex potestatis suae plenitudine summa prudentia finem huic rei optatum imponat quae non sine magno hujus regni ecclesiasticae dignitatis periculo diutius trahi potest speramus autem serenissimu hunc regem hujusmodi avocandae causae consilio facile quieturum salebrosa haec litium itinera labirinthos evitaturum modo fide sanctitatis vest ae chyrographo manus suae testata cognoverit se diutius suspenso hac animo detinendum non fore que ab hujusmodi matrimonio se tandem liberandum quo nec humano nec divino jure permanere se posse putat ex causis sanctitati vestrae forsan notis per ho suos nuntios longioribus verbis explicandis quod si sanctitas vestra commodius existimaverit avocatione hujusmodi posthabita per decretalis unius concessionem huic causae occurri succurri posse hanc quoque rationem regis animum paratum dabimus propterea concepto quodam decretalis modulo eum per ho ipsos majestatis suae nuntios mittimus ex quibus abunde intelliget

alia ratione hac ipsa via sibi suis que rebus omnibus que aliis optime consulat cujusmodi multa pro salute regni publica cum dignitate tum tranquillitate animo agitamus ut tandem optimo regi praesidio simus qui incredibili patientia humanitate nostram sanctitatis vestrae opem expectat sed tanta obsessus cura sollicitudine anxietate ut nullus facile explicare possit vix enim hoc ipso oculis auribus nostris credimus cujus usque adeo no miseret ut nihil ingrato magi animo audiamus quam ejus de hac verba querelas cruciatum jure injuria liceat nobis hoc beatissime pater cum sanctitate vestra tacere ne praejudicium nobis aut aliis faciamus sed quem non excitet tot annorum conscientiae carnificina quam ut transversum modo modo illas partes agant theologorum disputationes patrum decreta nullus non videt qua enucleanda ita ambiguo laboratur sensu ut jam non doctioris sed melioris hominis lumine pietate egeamus propterea factum est ut cum ab utra que parte stant assertores maximi illam magi majestas sua inclinat quae ab offensionibus periculis magi remota videtur quem praeterea non moveat dulcis illa insitaque sobolis successio qua morientes animam exhalaturi conquiescere natura ipsa videmur omnes quem insuper non accendat regni atque imperii propagatio per solo liberos continuata quaedam fruitio quem deni que populorum fidei ac ejus curae commissorum tranquillitas securitas quae designatis jam regibus principibus nutritur vivit non sollicitet ita ut tanti adeo que communis boni fundamenta nulla se jacta non doleat suspiret cum extremis ejus diebus extremum quoque tempora eis adventare sentiat que secum omnia quodammodo ruinam trahi majores habet beatissime pater causa haec anfractus difficultates quam superficie tenus inspectantibus offerantur qua vel hae potissimae sunt quod nec moram patitur alteram partem non inclinat quidem sed omnino cogit ni velimus ab ea praecipites maximum cum privatae tum publicae rei jactura cadere nam qui vel reginae odio vel speratae nec dum forsan notae futurae conjugis illecebra titillatione regem agi putant ii excordes plane toto quod aiunt coelo errare videntur ut enim credere dignum est nullis illius quamlib duris moribus aut injocunda consuetudine vel ulterioris sobolis spe desperata regium animum tanto periculo ad odium impelli posse ita nec hominis bene sani mente cadere debet regem hunc imbecillo adeo esse animo ut sensuum suadela eam abrumpere cupiat consuetudinem qua adolescentiae suae florentes annos exegerit persancte adeo ut hac quo que fluctuatione non sine reverentia honore versetur inest credite omnes voluntati ejus non modo divinae legis timor sed humani quo que juris ratio eximia haec que non privata sed publica ad quam cum ejus animum trahant utrius que juris peritissimi regni hujus sui proceres primate omnes nihil tamen suo aut suorum tantum arbitrio constitutum habere cupit sed apostolicae sedis judicio qua quantum sit pietate maxime ostendit quum non ex magorum carminibus circulatorum impos uris aliisve mali artibus sed sanctissima pontificis manu tanto huic vulneri suo opem petat de quo vel plura forte quam licuisset sanctitati vestrae subjecimus quoniam haec ipsa ulcera manibus

legitima petit auxilia regem de se apostolica sede optime meritum piaetatis suae sinu foveat illud que ei indulgeat quod nec disputationum immortalia dissidia nec litium immensum chaos unquam dabit nec sine maximo discrimine unquam tractabitur atque illud etiam secum reputet quam injurium cum privatis tum publicis rebus incommodum sit extremos juris apex consectari quanquam non expediat ex scripto jure semper judicari cui quia pontifex principe miro omnium consensu deo ipso praefecti censentur spiritus animae vice merito ambigui ubi multa periclitatur hominum salus arbitrio suo ejus duritiem moderari possunt debent quo sanctitas vestra regem regnum hoc plane servaverit quod si alia ratione vel aliunde paranda sibi fuerint auxilia veremur ne de regno rege hoc actum sit quicquid enim alia manu hui vulneri impositum fuerit nihil minus faciet quam sanitatem seditionibus enim tumultibus omnia exponentur que imprimis ecclesiastica dignitas apostolicae sedis authoritas hinc deturbabitur quod non erit difficile aut ingratum quibusdam qui rege cum sanctitate vestra nunc conjunctissimo impietatis suae venenum perbelle dissimulant cujusmodi jacturam si dura haec tempora nostra fecerunt quod deinde sperandum sit non videmus conservandus ita que rex est ejus que eximia apostolicam sedem voluntas fides ne eo nobis abalienato non modo angliae regem sed fidei quo que

pro comperto haberemus juris esse id fieri esset nihilominus denegatum quum praesertim petendo mandatum procuratorium tacite viderentur rejicere excusatorem per ipsum allegata sic autem illi nobis responderunt neque excusatorem fuisse rejectum ne que per ipsum allegata sed eodem quo prius statu permanere hoc autem excusatorium negotium minime ut nobis judicibus clarum sed dubium videri ibi que anconitanus quaedam nostris contraria adduxit quae karne suis literis recenset dicebant quo que hac favorabilius no quam adversarios fuisse tractatos illud etiam addentes quod si procuratorium mandatum mittatur justitia optime ministrabitur ac etiam quatenus fieri possit favorabiliter idque pontifex cardinales ambo constanter asseverabant quum vero no saepius diceremus excusatorem admitti debuisse dixerunt si recte considerare velimus no idem ipsum habuisse si enim aibant procurator hic constituatur literae remissoriae compulsoriae decernentur ad testis partibus examinandos item que vir aliquis probus ad id delegabitur ad utram que partem testesque scil examinandos ita ut processus partibus fiat atque hoc pacto no id consequi quod desideramus quoniam quod ad totius causae decisionem pertinet ex eo quod de pontificis potestate cognoscendum de jure divino disceptandum sit ac aliis etiam de causis ipsam decisionem pontifici integram semper reservari nihilominus oporteret

tandem ad definitionem determinationem sequentem quam communi omnium consensu justorum que animorum nostrorum judicio ac recto conscientiae dictaminae protulimus processimus hunc modum quod tenor vestrae commissionis exigit vestrae nobilissimae majestati hoc praesenti scripto referend duximus significamus prout sequitur primum ita que comperimus consideravimus matrimonium inter majestatem vestram nobilem foeminam dominam annam clevensem praetensam praecontracto quodam sive sponsaliorum sive matrimonii inter dictam dominam annam marchionem lotharingiae concluso ambiguum plane impeditum perplexum reddi annimadvertimus enim quod quamvis vestra majestas prima hujus matrimonii praetensi tractatione praecontractus praedicti de quo tum sermo multus habebatur discussionem declarationem ante solemnizandum cum dictum domina anna matrimonium tanta instantia exegerit ut pro conditione contrahendi deinde matrimonii fuisse merito existimari possit qua conditione defecta nihil ageretur que haec cum ita se haberent tamen neque ante solemnizationem illa de praecontractu ambiguitas expedita declarata est cum idipsum tum temporis majestas vestra denuo exposceret efflagitaret cui clara jam expedita esse omnia falso renunciabatur ne que postea quicquam efficax ut promissum ab oratoribus fuerat huc transmissum est quo scrupulus ille ex praecontractu natus eximeretur tolleretur aut amoveretur adeo quidem ut praetensum matrimonium inter majestatem vestram dominam annam praedictam non modo ex conditionis defectu corruerit sed si nulla conditio hujusmodi omnino fuisset certe quidem matrimonium hujusmodi praetensum ex sola praecontractus hujusmodi causa non explicata suspenso manserit eum etiam casum nullius vigoris omnino ac valoris pronunciandum quo praecontractum illum verbis de praesenti factum fuisse constiterit id quod multis de causis est verisimilius merito suspectum haberi potest consideravimus praeterea ex quae allegata affirmata probata nobis fuerunt quod praetensum matrimonium inter majestatem vestram dominam annam praedictam internum purum perfectum integrum consensum non habuit imo contra quemadmodum inter ipsa tractationis initia cum de hoc matrimonio ageretur plurimus illecebrarum fucus adhibitus est magnus laudationum acervus supra fidem cumulatus ut hic perduceretur obtruderetur ignota ita solemnizationis actus qui instabat majestate

majestatem vestram praedictam dominam annam minime secutam esse nec cum ea justo impedimento intercedente consequi deinde posse quae omnia ex quas audivimus probationibus vera certa esse existimamus postremo illud quo que consideramus quod nobis ab aliis propositum etiam no verum esse fatemur agnoscimus approbamus viz ut si majestas vestra modo ne fiat divinae jussioni praejudicium libertate contrahendi matrimonii cum alia esse declaretur maxime totius regni beneficio id futurum cum quidem regni foelicitas omnis conservatio tum regia vestra persona ad dei honorem divinarum legum executionem conservandam consistit tum vitandis etiam sinistris omnibus opinionibus scandalis quae de majestatis vestrae progenie post natam nobis ex praetenso matrimonio sobolem suborirentur si praecontractus ille de quo diximus cujus declaratio nulla secuta est praedictae dominae annae objiceretur ita que de causis considerationibus aliis que multis non necessariis quae exprimantur cum separatim singulis tum conjunctim omnibus consideratis perpensis no archiepiscopi episcopi cum decanis archiadiaconis reliquo hujus regni clero nunc congregato circumstantias facti ejus que veritatem ut antedictum est considerantes tum vero quid ecclesia hujusmodi casibus possit facere saepenumero antehac fecerit perpendentes tenore praesentium declaramus definimus majestatem vestram praedicto matrimonio praetenso utpote nullo invalido non alligari sed alio desuper judicio non expectato ecclesiae suae autoritate fretam posse arbitrio suo ad contrahend consummand matrimonium cum quavis

statuum confaederatorum consilium institutum hisce articulis non improbaturam esse primum enim serenissime ac potentissime rex de utraque specie non existimamus quenquam inficias iturum quin christi doctrina mandata ordinationes omnibus aliis praeceptis traditionibus aut caeremoniis humanis praeferri debeant hic enim cum ipse sit vita veritas errare non potest humana vero omnia praecipue rebus divinis incerta dubia sunt porro constat christum ipsum utram que speciem instituisse cum ait bibite ex hoc omnes paulum idem docuisse cum inquit cor probet seipsum homo sic de pane comedat poculo bibat quibus sane locis non de una parte ecclesiae id est de sacerdotibus tantum sed de tota ecclesia mentio fit nam quod quidam ita argumentantur solis apostolis christum id dixisse eaque de causa utram que speciem ad solo sacerdotes pertinere infirmum admodum est argumentum quia eadem ratione sequeretur quod laicis ne altera quidem specie danda esset neque enim alio loco christus mandavit solum corpus laicis dari utramque speciem pro sacerdotibus instituit sed hoc fatendum est quod illud mandatum christi de sacramento aut ad omnes hoc est laicos sacerdotes pertineat aut laici prorsus sacramento corporis etiam arcendi fuerint cum nusquam alibi evangelio nisi tunc um dedit apostolis simul corpus sanguinem sacramentum pro laicis institutum reperiatur idque ad omnes pertinere paulus declarat cum addit de poculo bibat c quod enim dicunt sacramenti divisionem urgentibus quibusdam causis ab ecclesia institutam esse sub una specie non minus quam sub utraque contineri non multum ad rem facit quis enim non intelligit hic de christi instituto mandato agi idque humanae auctoritati opinionibus longe praeferendum esse neque enim ecclesia sumit sibi hanc libertatem ex christi ordinationibus re indifferentes constituendi rationes illae vel de discrimine ordinum seu dignitate sacerdotali vel periculo effusionis simile nullo modo tantam queunt vim habere ut propterea divinae ordinationes mutandae sint neque ulla etiam consuetudo contra mandata dei introducta ipsis canonibus pontificiis attestantibus probanda est constat vero usum utriusque speciei clarum habere mandatum christi adprobationem sanctorum patrum ac consuetudinem veteris ecclesiae sic enim inquit divus hieronymus sacerdotes qui eucharistiae serviunt sanguinem christi populis distribuunt gelasius pontifex sacramenti corporis sanguinis domini divisionem prohibet eamque grande sacrilegium adpellat adhaec durat hodie hic mo communionis utriusque speciei graecis ecclesiis quae hac romani pontificis tyrannidi semper restiterunt neque ejus jugum recipere voluerunt testantur historiae tum germania tum multis aliis regionibus ac provinciis verum communionis usum diu conservatum fuisse sed tandem fulminibus romani antichristi quibus totum paene orbem terrarum conterruit subjugavit homines ut verisimile est victi veru eucharistiae usum mutarunt ad quem tamen per singularem dei gratiam agnita iterum veritate evangelica cum principe nostri tum alii evangelii doctrinam profitentes jam redierunt sese ac suos universae ecclesiae maxime salutifera tanquam libertatem excusso jugo pontificio vendicarunt adseruerunt nam quae causae pontificem permoverint ut contra christi mandatum institutum contra sententiam sanctorum patrum contra consuetudinem universae ecclesiae christianae sacramentum divideret laicos sanguine domini nefarie spoliaret facile serenissima regia majestas vestra perspicit verisimile quidem videtur eum voluisse suam suique ordinis auctoritatem ac dignitatem ea ratione augere hoc discrimen inter laicos sacerdotes constituere nam etiam nunc clamitant adversarii laicos debere esse altera specie contentos quasi regnum aliquod possideant ita imperare ipsis liberum sit ut etiam christi beneficium hominibus eripere queant ad quod potius si suo officio fungi vellent omnes invitare pellicere deberent sed quid christo cum belial quid pontifici cum christi instituto cujus ipse se summum adversarium esse satis declarat ideoque tum hoc tum aliis salutaribus religionis christianae articulis oportuit ipsum scriptura discedere imo doctrinam evangelio consentaneam damnare ut manifestum fieret eum esse antichristum de quo passim scriptura talia praedixit porro altero articulo de missa privata de missa privatae adhuc magi adparet romano pontifice religionem christianam adeo oppressam obscuratam ut christi beneficium qui sua morte no redemit solusque est hostia satisfactio pro peccatis nostris penitus sustulerit ejus locum idololatricum cultum pro abolendis peccatis ecclesiam invexerit eamque suis erroribus prophanationibus miserabiliter implicaverit turbaverit deformaverit cum enim missa nihil aliud sit nec esse debeat quam communio sive synaxis ut paulus adpellat neque etiam alius ejus usus fuerit tempore apostolorum veteris ecclesiae quemadmodum hoc clare ex patribus probari potest plane diversum quoddam opus prorsus pugnans cum communione vero missae usu inde factum est quod docent ex opere operato ut loquuntur mereri gratiam tollere peccata vivorum mortuorum haec opinio quantopere distet scripturis ac gloriam passionis christi laedat sereniss regia majestas vestra facillime judicabit si enim hoc verum est quod missa pro aliis applicari potest quod peccata tollit prodest tam vivis quam mortuis sequitur justificationem ex opere missarum contingere non ex fide verum hoc omnino scripturae repugnat quae tradit no gratis propter christum per fidem justificari ac peccata nobis condonari gratiam no recipi atque ita non alieno opere sed propria fide propter christum singulos justos ieri illi docent alienum opus pro remittendis peccatis alteri quod quidem merum est somnium figmentum humanum repugnans evangelicae doctrinae nam tunc demum adplicatur gratia per verbum sacramentorum usum cum ipsi utimur sacramentis sed isti pro aliis utuntur quod perinde est ac si pro aliis baptizarentur neque vero potest dici quantopere deformet christi gloriam opinio illa de missa quae ex opere operato conferat gratiam aut applicata pro aliis mereatur eis remissionem venialium mortalium peccatorum culpae poenae idque aperte adversari scripturae vero usu missae sive communionis longe discedere vel inde liquet quia missa sive synaxis ideo est instituta ut fides li qui utitur sacramento recordetur quae beneficia accipiat per christum erigat ac soletur pavidam conscientiam ideoque ibi porrigi debet sacramentum quibus opus est consolatione sicut ambrosius ait quia semper pecco semper debeo accipere medicinam atque hic usque ad tempora gregorii ecclesia missae usus fuit neque antea privatae missae cognitae fuerunt quod quidem cum multis aliis patrum sententiis patet tum chrysostomi qui inquit sacerdotem stare ad altare alios ad communionem accersere alios arcere et ex veteribus canonibus constat unum aliquem celebrasse missam quo reliqui presbyteri diaconi sumpserunt corpus domini sic enim inquit canon nicenus accipiant diaconi secundum ordinem post presbyteros ab episcopo vel presbytero sacram communionem et scribit epiphanius asia synaxim ter celebratam singulis septimanis nec quotidianas fuisse missas eumque morem ab apostolis traditum esse qui quidem missae usus etiam hodie graecis parochiis durare dicitur nam tantum singulis dominicis diebus festis fit ibi una publica missa privatas vero non habent fuitque graeca ecclesia hoc nomine longe foelicior quam latina quae meliorem usum coenae domini synaxis sive missae retinuerit neque vel sacramentum corporis sanguinis domini contra claram evangelii doctrinam diviserit ut paulo ante diximus neque etiam privatas missas sacrae scripturae acerrime repugnantes receperit cujus quidem rei hanc potentissimam causam fuisse arbitramur quod graeca ecclesia romanum episcopum auctorem perversae idololatricae doctrinae omnium poene abusuum qui ecclesiam introducti sunt pro summo ecclesiae universalis sive catholicae capite nunquam agnoverit sed concedunt quidam adplicationes quae f unt missa pro vivis mortuis item opiniones quod ex opere operato gratiam mereri traduntur non esse probandas disputant abolitis illis opinionibus impiis alia ratione missas privatas retinendas nempe quia sunt gratiarum actiones quae possint ab uno vel pluribus fieri haec sane ratio videtur aliquam habere speciem estque nonlatin alphabet ut inquit sophocles quo causis invalidis ut ipse ait morbidis utendum sit si missa tantum esset gratiarum actio possit fortassis talus aliquo praetextu colorari verum constat eam principaliter institutam esse ut sit sacramentum quod per ministrum alteri exhibeatur ut accipiens credens consequatur gratiam et hoc quidem principali fine posito accedit alter de gratiarum actione quare nullo modo ab institutione christi recedere sed modum formam illius institutionis exemplum veteris ecclesiae sequi retinere debemus nulla enim novitas praesertim sacramentis recipienda est contra formam christo traditam contra exempla veteris ecclesiae porro constat privatas missas esse recentes romani pontificibus introductas ne hodie quidem ut paulo ante dictum est graecis ecclesiis esse nisi parochiales diebus festis cum quibus adhuc manet vestigium communionis cum igitur contra dei verbum missa privata introducta sit eamque humanum tantum commentitium cultum esse adpareat quis dubitat quin talis missa sine ullo periculo omitti possit imo debeat cum repugnet evangelio estque pium sanctum opus verum missae sive synaxis usum ecclesiae restituere ac reddere quo per romanum pontificem hoc est antichristum multis jam annis miserabiliter privata fuit qui quidem adhuc mordicusprivatas missas tenet adserit defendit neque id immerito facile enim sentit quod labefactata missa privata labefactetur imo ruat universum ejus regnum tyranni quae missis illis nititur ut enim seminibus causa est arborum stirpium ita hujus luctuosissimi dominatus imperii tyrannidis nundinationis idololatriae pontificiae semen fuit superstitio missarum privatarum nam hae pepererunt sustinuerunt veluti atlas quidam totum papatum ad harum normam omnia redacta sunt siquidem nihil fuit quod non missa aliqua expiari posse creditum est aucupatus pontifex romanus indulgentias quibus immensam pecuniam ex toto orbe terrarum praedatus est hae monachorum turbas infinitas coacervarunt cum eorum nullus alius esset usus quam demurmurandi missas privatas alioquin inutile terrae pondus forent hae sunt fuerunt universa pieta quam pontifex romanus profitetur hanc solam novit ille religionem quae missis privatis consistit doctrinam enim evangelii non modo non habet verum acerrime odit prosequitur summa missis ipsam praedicationem verbi divini pontifex exterminavit ut per omnia antichristi munere fungeretur nam loco unius concionis verbi amplius mille missae privatae hoc est humani commentitii cultus contra divinum verbum successerunt cum non missas fieri sed evangelium praedicare sacramenta rite distribuere administrare christus apostolis quorum illi volunt esse successores mandaverit curarunt igitur illustrissimi principe nostri alii evangelii doctrinam profitentes principe status privatas missas penitus aboleri verum missae usum sive synaxim christi institutioni exemplo apostolorum veteris ecclesiae ac patrum sententiis conformem ecclesiam revocarunt restituerunt quae quidem missa sive synaxis summa cum reverentia celebratur servatis pene omnibus usitatis caeremoniis quae non repugnant pietati admiscentur germanicae sive vernaculae cautiones ad docendum populum praecepit enim paulus ecclesia uti lingua intellecta populo porro quia propter communionem sive usum sacramenti missa instituta est hi qui sunt idonei antea explorati sacramento utuntur ac dignitas usus sacramenti summa diligentia ac cura ex verbo dei populo commendatur ut sciant intelligant homines quantam consolationem pavidis conscientiis adferat ac discant deo credere optimum quaeque ab eo expectare petere et hunc quidem sacramenti missae usum scripturae consentaneum deo gratum pietati conducibilem esse serenissima regia majestas vestra facile agnoscit neque enim hic aliquid contra dei verbum admittitur imo secundum christi mandatum ordinationem qui hanc sacram communionem ad hunc finem instituit omnia geruntur nulla est hic admixta prava aut impia opinio ut missa privata papistica cujus finis institutio cum evangelio pugnat nihil hic etiam absque summa reverentia ordine decoro digno ecclesiae fieri cernitur audemusque adfirmare majore religione hunc verum missae usum exhiberi apud no quam hactenus unquam sub papatu privatae missae celebratae fuerint provocamusque ad testimonia doctissimorum virorum qui majestate vestra missi illis locis fuerunt haec omnia coram fieri viderunt audierunt quod enim adversarii clamitant nostros omnes cultus divinos omnes caeremonias omnem denique religionem abolere labefactare ea principibus nostris aliis evangelii doctrinam profitentibus injuriam faciunt haec eos insigni quadam malevolentia odio plusquam vatiniano ut dici solet confingere comminisci clare adparet cum ex doctrina nostrorum quam consentientem sacris literis lucem ediderunt scriptis suis universo orbi christiano promulgarunt tum etiam exemplis nostrarum ecclesiarum quibus nolint velint coguntur fateri omnia religiosius sanctius fieri quam apud ipsos immo dei beneficio universus populus non tantum templis est religiosior sed tota disciplina publica modestius se gerit majoremque erga magistratum civilem eos qui ecclesiis praesunt reverentiam honorem exhibet quam unquam antea factum fuerit hoc sincerae evangelii doctrinae acceptum referre debemus quae singulos rectius omnibus pontificiis constitutionibus sui officii admonet sola quibus vera pieta ac cultus divinus consistat tradit ac docet porro quod missae collocatae ad quaestum ut sub papatu accidit turpiter prophanentur quodque hic abusus omnibus pene templis latissime pateat non est obscurum nam christi beneficium qui no precioso suo sanguine redemit idque gratuito pro vili stipe mercede vendere tale etiam opus inde constituere velle quod ex sui natura hoc est ex opere operato mereatur gratiam possit adplicari pro peccatis aliorum mortuorum vivorum quis non videt summam esse impietatem quid enim est corpus domini indigne tractare sumere si hoc non esset potest etiam magi impium quidquam dici quam illi de missis istis docuerunt nempe quod christus sua passione satisfecerit pro peccatis originis instituerit missam qua fieret oblatio pro quotidianis delictis mortalibus venialibus cum christus poenitentiam remissionem peccatorum praedicari mandaverit missam vero hoc est synaxim ad alium plane finem instituerit viz ut porrigatur sacramentum quibus opus est consolatione ut per verbum sacramentum credentes gratiam recipiant remissionem peccatorum consequantur non ut ipsi suum opus quod quale quale sit humanum figmentum humanus cultus est contra scripturam deo offerant ac sacrificent hoc enim non placat deum ut christus ipse inquit se frustra coli mandatis hominum nam missam non esse tale opus sive sacrificium quod mereatur gratiam prosit etiam aliis inde adparet quia missa sive synaxis ad hoc est instituta non ut deo aliquid offeratur sed ut communicantes consolationem hauriant veluti pignus seu certum signum gratiae ac bonae voluntatis dei erga se recipiant atque ita recordentur mortis christi hoc est beneficiorum quae per christum accipiunt qui quidem pro nobis mortuus est solusque pro peccatis nostris satisfecit idque probant verba ipsa quibus christus paulus de missa sive synaxi usi sunt primum enim inquit christus hoc est corpus meum quod pro vobis traditur haec sunt verba promissionis divinae quae solam fidem exigunt quibusque offertur nobis gratia remissio peccatorum ergo non est sacrificium hoc est opus quod deo offeratur quidem pro abolendis peccatis item paulus ait annunciantes mortem domini annunciare autem non est sacrificare hoc est tale opus deo reddere quo peccata deleantur praeterea evangelii textus ita sonat fregit dedit discipulis inquiens accipite comedite c item bibite ex hoc omnes c accipere autem comedere bibere non est sacrificare quia haec opera ex opere operato non delent peccata neque mandatur hisce verbis ut no deo aliquid offeramus sed potius ut ab eo accipiamus quia addit pro vobis traditum sanguis qui pro vobis effunditur quae verba ostendunt non exhiberi sumentibus eucharistiam deo sacrificium sed donum hominibus datum praeterea vero nemo dicit laicos cum sumunt sacramentum sacrificare quantum ad hanc sacram communionem missam sive synaxim pertinet nulla est ratio diversitatis cum idem christus uno eodemque tempore ac momento propter eundem finem usum hoc sacramentum absque differentia utentium sacerdotum vel laicorum instituerit et quemadmodum prohibitio utriusque speciei humanum tantum commentum mandatum est ita quod de sacrificio missae ex opere operato gratiam promerente traditur humana tantum opinio est contra verbum dei quo rebus maximis nempe ad remissionem peccatorum salutem animarum vitam aeternam pertinentibus nullo modo est discedendum non enim frustra paulus inquit bi repetit si no aut angelus de coelo evangelizet vobis praeter id quod evangelizavimus accepistis anathema sit praeterea nec potest ratio diversitatis adsignari ex sacris literis cur magi dicant eos qui sacramento eucharistiae fruuntur sacrificare quam illos qui alio sacramento ut baptismo utuntur cum utrumque nihil aliud sit quam sacramenta quae christus horum institutor auctor prorsus ad alium finem quam ut sint talia sacrificia qualia illi comminiscuntur ordinavit sed oportuit romanum pontificem missas privatas ad opprimendam christi cum ipse hostis est gloriam attollere ut populum christianum veritate evangelica agnitione christi sacramentorum legitimo usu prorsus abduceret christique bonitatem misericordiam obliteraret qui enim missam ale sacrificium esse cogitant quo deus placetur hi non queunt christi beneficium expendere pro dignitate terroribus ac doloribus irae judicii dei non habebunt refugium neque bo conscientia poterunt signa amoris divina agnoscere si alieno opere deum placari peccata remitti sibi persuasum habeant nam illi ipsi qui nituntur impias opiniones de missa privata excusare hoc praetextu quasi missa ideo vocetur sacrificium quia sit gratiarum actio sacrificium laudis hi convincuntur propriis ipsorum testimoniis scriptis quae de missis extant haeque persuasiones hominum animis etiam hodie de missis privatis inhaerent sic enim thomas inquit opusculo de sacramento altaris cur missa instituta sit corpus domini semel oblatum est cruce pro debito originali sic offeratur jugiter pro quotidianis delictis altari ut habeat hoc ecclesia munus ad placandum sibi deum super omnia legis sacrificia preciosum acceptum alexander papa nihil sacrificiis ecclesiae majus esse potest quam corpus sanguis christi nec ulla oblatio hac potior est sed omnes praecellit item ipsa veritas no instruit calicem ac panem sacramento offerre quando ait accipite comedite nam crimina que peccata oblatis domino sacrificiis delentur et rursus inquit talibus hostiis delectabitur placabitur deus peccata dimittet ingentia gabriel de canon missae sacramentum eucharistiae veluti sacrificium summo patri oblatum nedum veniale sed etiam mortale non dico sumentium sed omnium eorum pro quibus offertur quantum ad reatum culpae poenae plus vel minus secundum dispositionem eorum pro quibus offertur tollit unde thomas quarto dist q eucharistia quantum est sacrificium habet effectum etiam aliis pro quibus offertur quibus non praeexigit vitam spiritualem actu sed potentia ideo si eos dispositos inveniat eis gratiam obtinet virtute illius veri sacrificii quo omnis gratia no fluxit per consequens peccata mortalia eis delet non sicut causa proxima sed quantum gratiam contritionis eis impetrat similibus omnes libri scolasticorum pleni sunt quibus uno ore docent missam tale esse sacrificium quo gratiam homines mereantur ex opere operato quod ad delenda aliorum peccata adplicari possit quae doctrina aut potius perversum impium figmentum pugnet cum sacris literis necne verum missae seu communionis usum tradat necne christi beneficium non magi obscuret quam illustret imo etiam prorsus tollat vestrae serenissimae regiae majestati dijudicandum relinquimus quae pro sua sapientia non tantum rebus politicis sed etiam sacris omni genere doctrinarum acerrimo judicio facile censebit justissimam causam habuisse principe nostros alios evangelii doctrinam profitentes missas privatas abrogandi verum missae sive communionis usum pro christi gloria consolatione totius ecclesiae christianae restituendi revocandi postquam ex dei verbo cognoverunt quantum privatae missae veritate evangelica distent quantum que ii insit impietatis idololatriae fuit enim unicum sacrificium propitiatorium mundo viz mors christi qui ut paulus inquit semel est pro nobis oblatus factus hostia pro peccatis nostris quod caetera legis sacrificia propitiatoria significarunt quae similitudine quadam erant satisfactiones redimentes justitiam legis ne ex politia excluderentur illi qui peccaverant ea que cessaverunt post revelatum evangelium novo testamento necesse est cultum tantum esse spiritualem hoc est justitiam fidei fructus fidei quia adfert justitiam vitam spiritualem aeternam juxta dabo legem meam cordibus eorum christus ait veri adoratores adorabunt patrem spiritu veritate id est vero cordis adfectu qua de causa abrogati sunt levitici cultus quod debeant succedere cultus spirituales mentis horum fructus ac signa ut epistola ad hebraeos manifeste docetur ex quibus omnibus sequitur missam non esse sacrificium quod ex opere operato mereatur faciente vel aliis remissionem peccatorum ut illi docuerunt et quocun que quidam fuco nitantur excusare missas privatas semper eis refragatur reclamat doctrina ipsoru de missa qua eam aliis posse adplicari tradiderunt peccata delere hominibus persuaserunt haec opinio nisi restituto vero missae usu nunquam ex animis hominum delebitur sed perpetuo manet redit error quod oporteat talem esse cultum ecclesia quo deus placetur et ut videatur fictione juris ut jureconsulti loquuntur missam posse vocari sacrificium memoriale sive laudis cum id non sit satisfactorium pro facientibus vel adplicabile pro aliis quo quis mereatur remissionem peccatorum quorsum attinebit relicto vero ejus usu institutione id ecclesiam introducere ubi propter nullam humanam rationem commentum aut opinionem christi mandato ordinatione est discedendum eadem enim ratione natalis domini similia festa quae christi memoriam celebrantur sacrificia memorialia sive eucharistica dici possent imo talia sacrificia verius sunt evangelii praedicatio fides invocatio gratiarum actio adflictiones aut adplicationes pro aliis missae principalis finis ut supra disseruimus est ut sit sacramentum quod per ministrum alteri exhibeatur quare non potest dici sacrificium cum nemo ignoret magnum inter sacrificia sacramenta discrimen esse enim no dona deo oblata accipimus illis vero nostrum deo reddimus offerimus neque vero habent privatae missae alios auctores quam pontifex qui tempore gregorii nunc hanc nunc illam caeremoniam cantionem aut orationem singuli pro sua sanctitate opinione adjecerunt ut historiae uno consensu testantur donec eandem egregium illud opus dignum istis auctoribus exaedificarunt relicto vero missae sive communionis usu ac obliterata doctrina de christo universa ecclesia missis privatis qua sola omnem poene sanctitatem posuerunt repleta obruta fuit haec serenissime ac potentissime rex nostrorum principum aliorum imperii ordinum evangelicam doctrinam profitentium theologi doctores justis voluminibus explicarunt quae quidem hac epistola no breviter adtingenda duximus non quod serenissimam regiam majestatem vestram haec latere penitus putemus neque enim ignoramus serenissimae regiae majestati vestrae veteru recentiu scripta de aliis controversiis ecclesiasticis diligentissime cognita esse de quibus etiam majestas vestra sapientissime eruditissime saepe cum doctis viris conferre disputare solet sed haec ideo fecimus ut majestati vestrae quam posset fieri brevissime occasionem causa quasdam abolitaru privatarum missarum apud no summa cum observantia ut decet exponeremus adversariorum calumnias quibus cum apud regiam majestatem vestram tum alias undecunque quaesita arrepta occasione variis technis figmentis doctrinam sinceriorem gravare odium omnium perducere conantur declinaremus neque vero ambigimus quin majestas vestra ut rex eruditissimus veritatis evangelicae amantissimus facillime judicabit quod non temere privatae missae apud no abrogatae sint sed justissimis firmissimis rationibus ex dei verbo quod solum errare non potest sincere absque sophistica deductis pro conservanda illustranda christi gloria hominum salute id factum esse et opponantur qualescunque excogitari possint cavillationes sophismata tamen adparebit nostros hoc agere quod sit tutius dum retinent modum formam institutionis christi ac maximum par sacerdotum sua sponte apud no desiit missas privatas celebrare posteaquam intellexerunt ex evangelica doctrina quantum ii erroris impietatis esset plurimi ac doctissimi quique qui sacerdotia aut parochias sub magistratibus alienis sincera evangelii doctrina tenebant ea deseruerunt ne cogerentur facere contra suas conscientias seque ad ea loca quibus evangelii doctrina libere praedicatur contulerunt gravissimum enim est quenquam praesertim talus quae dei gloriam laedit ac divino verbo repugnat tanquam ad cultum divinum adigi compelli sed ne serenissimae regiae majestati vestrae prolixitate literarum simus molesti desinemus plura de hoc articulo inpraesentiarum disserere restat tertius locus instituti argumenti de conjugio sacerdotum viz de conjugio sacerdotum quod itidem romanus episcopus contra scripturam contra leges naturae contra omnem honestatem prohibuit ac multorum peccatorum scelerum turpitudinis occasionem praebuit sed fortassis ne possit dubitari eum esse christi adversarium de quo cum illam ipsam prohibitionem tum alia quaedam quae illum solum adperte quadrant scriptura clare praedixit oportuit eum talem legem caelibatus sacerdotalis sancire ut sicut leo ex unguibus ita papa hoc est antichristus ab hac prohibitione sanctissimi omnibus honorabilis conjugii agnosceretur sic enim paulus inquit spiritus autem manifeste dicit quod novissimis temporibus discedent quidam fide attendentes spiritibus erroris doctrinis daemoniorum hypocrisi loquentium mendacium cauteriatam habentium conscientiam suam prohibentium nubere haec si non romanum episcopum congruunt quem alium convenient nemo enim alius quam ipse conjugium sacerdotibus injustissime eripuit caelibatum impurissimum sub specie sanctitatis ut paulus ait hypocrisi per mendacium introduxit scriptura non minus sacerdotibus quam alterius sortis hominibus matrimonium liberum permittit sunt enim de eadem carne quae totum genus humanum vestit continet nati non possunt igitur naturam suam mutare non possunt carnem abjicere nec absque singulari dei dono caelibes vivere nam non quilibet ut christus inquit capit verbum hoc paulus propter fornicationem unusquisque suam uxorem habeat peculiariter de sacerdotibus ait constituas per civitates presbyteros sicut disposui tibi si quis sine crimine est unius uxoris vir filios habens fideles non accusatione luxuriae item oportet episcopum esse irreprehensibilem unius uxoris virum patet igitur hanc prohibitionem non ex jure divino sed potius contra sacram scripturam decretum esse solet quibusdam pontificiis defensoribus opponi quod licet conjugium sacerdotum non videatur vetitum divinis literis tamen sacerdotes veteribus temporibus hunc usque diem caelibatu vixisse eaque de causa addunt non esse discedendum hac talus exemplo neque permittendum conjugium sacerdotibus serenissime ac potentissime rex adperte refragantur historiae tum ecclesiasticae tum aliae ex quibus clare patet episcopos sacerdotes veteribus temporibus conjugatos fuisse primum enim spiridion cyprius episcopus vir unus ex ordine prophetarum ut historia ecclesiastica ait uxorem habuit ex qua filiam nomine irenen suscepit deinde ordine pene omnes episcopi uxorati fuerunt quorum plurimi filii postea tum romani tum alii episcopi creati sunt fuit enim sylverius papa hormisdae episcopi filius papa theodorus theodori episcopi hierosolymitani papa adrianus secundus talari episcopi joannes decimus papa sergii papae gelasius valerii episcopi papa joannes decimus quintus leonis presbyteri filius ne omnes enumeremus patet vel unica historia polycratis ex cujus parentibus septem fuerunt per ordinem episcopi ipse vero fuit octavus non est credibile omnes illos ex illegitimis nuptiis prognatos esse cum ipsi canones decreta synodorum doceant conjugia sacerdotum esse licita sic enim inquit canon apostolorum si quis docuerit sacerdotem sub obtentu religionis propriam uxorem contemnere anathema sit item extat praeclarum exemplum de paphnutio confessore qui universae synodo nicenae prohibitionem conjugii dissuasit obtinuit ne hac ex parte ancitum sed hoc uniuscujusque voluntate non necessitate permissum fuerit quae historia etiam jure pontificio recensetur extatque decretum quoddam sextae synodi quo palam damnatur prohibitio conjugii sacerdotalis sed objicitur iterum propter votum castitatis quod sacerdotes praestiterunt non posse eis permitti nuptias hoc quale votum sit quamque obligatorium quod sine peccato servari non potest serenissima regia majestas vestra pro summa sapientia doctrina facile aestimabit neque enim donum castitatis omnibus datum est idque caelibatus ipse sacerdotum quotidiana experientia etiam nunc testatur quid de talus voto sentiendum sit sanctorum patrum sententia declaravit sic enim augustinus ait quidam nubentes post votum adserunt adulteros esse ego autem dico vobis quod graviter peccant qui tale dividunt et cyprianus de virginibus qui continentiam voverunt sic inquit si perseverare nolunt vel non possunt melius est ut nubant quam ut ignem delitiis suis cadant censent itaque praedicti sancti patres tale votum non debere impedire matrimonium sicut revera etiam non potest obstare quo minus hi quibus donum continentiae non contigit matrimonium contrahant nam melius est nubere quam uri ut inquit paulus quid autem est impurius coelibatu illo sacerdotali quam pauci vero continent quam plurimi fornicationibus adulteriis id genus similibus ac gravioribus peccatis flagitiis pene quotidie deprehenduntur contra quod sileges severe animadverterent non habituri essent quo de illo ficto hypocritico coelibatu adeo gloriarentur ac tradunt historiae germania triennium aut amplius sacerdotes acerrime restitisse sanctioni pontificis hildebrandi de caelibatu qui summa vi eis uxores adimere conatus est hique justissimas causa contra illam constitutionem ac tyrannidem pontificiam pro matrimonio defendendo allegarunt qua cum nihil aequi obtinere potuerint tandem ingens orta est seditio contra archiepiscopum moguntinum qui decretum pontificium detulat adeo ut ab incaepto destiterit vix tandem papa post multas diras execrationes bulla quibus etiam coelum ipsum expugnare conatus est miseris sacerdotibus facultatem liberam conjugii contra divina humana jura abstulerit omnis generis libidinis impuritatis exercendae occasionem praebuerit extat quoque epistola ad nicolaum episcopum romanum divi udalrici episcopi augustensis qua gravissimis optimis argumentis dissuadet damnat prohibitionem conjugii sacerdotum cum igitur principe nostri alii porfitentes evangelii doctrinam patefacta per dei gratiam iterum veritate intellexerint quid de prohibitione illa pontificia conjugii sacerdotalis sentiendum esset palam viderent experirentur quod non posset coelibatus ille sine peccatis scandalis consistere reperunt ea etiam vincula pontificia ac matrimonium sacerdotibus sicut hoc scriptura sacrum exempla sanctorum patrum ac veteris ecclesiae exigunt testantur liberum permiserunt existimarunt enim hoc quoque ad suum officium pertinere ut infinitorum scandalorum scelerum quae necessario secum trahit caelibatus sacerdotalis occasionem materiam praescinderent auferrent publicaeque honestati hac quoque consulerent maxime cum animadverterent quantae etiam abominationes ordine sacerdotali monasteriis vestalium ac monachorum evenerint quibus compertum est saepe infantes crudeliter necatos pharmacis foetus depulsos similia nefaria crimina commissa quos solo fructus caelibatus ille protulit ideoque plurimi nunc sunt conjugati sacerdotes apud no multi etiam caelibes idque cujusque conscientiae ut vel ducat uxorem vel conjugio abstineat permittitur modo ita vivat ne sit aliis offendiculo alioqui enim non minus sacerdotes quam reliquum vulgus hac quoque parte secundum leges politicas animadvertitur ac per dei gratiam hoc inde secutum est quod eorum conscientiis quibus continentiae donum non contigit consultum fuerit plurimorum flagitiorum scelerum occasio cessaverit matronis ac puellis quibus plerique istorum sub specie pietatis saepissime inhiabant laqueos nectebant nihil ejusmodi periculi sit summa quod quum tum officia ecclesiastica tum politica majore reverentia honestate tractentur quodque ab universis majore honore favore habeantur sacerdotes quam antea illo pleno scandulis caelibatu acciderit id quoque magna ex parte honestum conjugium sacerdotum praestat adhaec nulli acrius constantius oppugnant romanum pontificem tum matrimonii libertatem tum sanam doctrinam ab illo obscuratam oppressam defendunt quam hi qui ab ejus jugo impuri illius caelibatus liberati sunt honeste etiam o liberos quos ex conjugio suscipiunt educare solent quibus haud dubie deus etiam post mortem parentum ubi timore domini aliti edocti fuerint prospiciet gravissimum enim esset sacerdotes ideo conjugio arcere quia sua munia sive officia tantum ad vitam suam non autem jure haereditario tenent eadem ratione multis aliis qui sunt aut publicis muneribus aut privatis ministeriis matrimonium interdicendum foret quod quidem si fieret reip plus incommodi quam boni allaturum esset cum sacrarum literarum

putemus vos id serio affirmasse sed forsan probandi causa nobis id protulisse ut quid sentiamus intelligeretis nam ipsa opinio tam aliena est rectum scripturae intelligentia ut vix quivis id serio affirmare praesumeret quod latius hac epistola declarabimus nec nobis persuadere possumus etsi occasio sit vos non nobiscum credere quod sub specie panis sit realiter substantialiter verum vivum corpus christi una cum corpore sanguis verus alioqui fatendum e set corpus ibi exsangue esse quod nefas esset dicere cum caro illa christi non modo viva sed vivificatrix sit quod sub specie vini non modo vivus verus christi sanguis sit sed etiam una cum vero sanguine viva vera etiam corporis sit caro quod cum ita sit necessario consequetur etiam eos qui sub altera specie communicant solum sub specie panis corpus christi sumunt non fraudari communione sanguinis christi atque eos etiam qui sub specie vini communicant non fraudari communione corporis domini quocirca cum sub alterutra specie utrum que contineatur viz corpus sanguis christi utravis solum specie porrigatur populis utrumque id est tam sanguis quam corpus christi per hoc eisdem exhibeatur nam christus ipse sub altera specie dedisse legitur evangelio lucae discipulis duobus emaus euntibus quando agnitus est fractione panis scribitur enim quod cum recumberet cum eis accepit panem benedixit ac fregit porrigebat illis aperti sunt oculus eorum cognoverunt eum fractione panis ubi de eucharistia eum locum vetustissimi authores chrysostomus theophylactus augustinus intelligunt tamen de vini poculo nulla ibi sit mentio unde christus qui altera specie miuistravit eucharistiam libertatem ecclesiae sponsae suae reliquisse videtur ut imitetur sponsi sui vestigia ac similiter sub altera specie sicut sub utraque communicare libere possit nam christus qui sub utra que specie communionem docuit etiam de communione sub altera ipse exemplum reliquit qui secum tamen nusquam vel praeceptis vel exemplis dissidet simile idem lucas actis apostolorum citat quando post adventum spiritus sancti praedicante petro appositae sunt animae circiter tria millia inquiens erant autem perseverantes doctrina apostolorum communicatione fractione panis orationibus ubi similiter de eucharistia eum locum intelligunt veteres de poculo nulla fit ibi mentio jam si christum ipsum autorem si apostolos ab eo ad docendum orbem missos patronos habet communio sub una specie nempe panis usitata ecclesia non est tanquam evangelicis praeceptis contraria statim repudianda nam apostoli qui per adventum spiritus edocti sunt omnem veritatem nunquam fractione panis communionem dedissent populo si utra que specie de praecepto christi semper necessario fuisset porrigenda ne christi jubentis parum memores institutum ejus mutasse viderentur porro ipsa christi verba quae post evangelistas paulus totam coenam dominicam corrinthiis enarrans citat no admonent christum separatim de alterutra specie locutum esse ait enim dominus iesus qua nocte tradebatur accepit panem gratias agens fregit dixit accipite manducate hoc est corpus meum quod pro vobis traditur hoc facite mei commemorationem ecce christus de corpore suo sub specie panis sumendo separatim locutus est inquiens hoc facite priusquam ullam de poculo faceret mentionem postea autem de calice ait paulus similiter calicem postquam caenavit accepit dicens hic calix novum testamentum est meo sanguine hoc facite quotiescun que bibetis mei commemorationem nec dixit sicut de corpore dixerat simpliciter hoc facite mei commemorationem sed dixit hoc facite cum hac adjectione nempe quotiescun que bibetis mei commemorationem per hoc nobis indicans non semper sub specie vini sumendum esse sanguinem una cum corpore sub specie panis sed quotiescun que sumeretur sanguis sub specie vini commemorationem christi id faciendum ecce rursum christus post distributionem corporis sui peracta coena qua corpus suum sub specie panis separatim prius dederat iterum separatim sub specie vini sanguinem suum offert inquiens hoc facite quotiescun que bibetis mei commemorationem significans nobis seorsum nonnunquam alterum porrigi posse tamen cum ita sit utrius que vim integram populis dari alioqui suffecisset semel duntaxat de utro que fuisse dictum hoc facite nec de calice adjecisset hoc facite quotiescunque bibetis cum prius de specie panis simpliciter dixisset hoc facite nisi separatim ea sumi posse judicaret neque quisquam negare potest discipulos coena sub specie panis sumpsisse corpus christi nam coenantibus illis accepit panem benedixit ac fregit dedit que illis dicens hoc est corpus meum calicem autem non nisi post intervallum ac peracta coena porrexit nisi quis adeo stupidus esset ut crederet post sumptionem speciei panis non prius eos sumpsisse corpus christi quum postquam caenavit porrexisset calicem quasi vero priora verba christi irrita fuissent cum de specie panis diceret hoc est corpus meum aut ipsa distribut facta discipulis nullam vim haberet priusquam de calice peracta caena bibissent quod cum impium sit sentire tum ipsum verbum factum christi proh nefas evacuat denique ipse paulus postquam etiam de utraque specie conjunctim locutus est rursum de ipsis speciebus disjunctim infert inquiens nonlatin alphabet quae verba latine sic transtulit erasmus ita que quisquis ederit panem hunc aut de calice biberit indigne reus erit corporis sanguinis domini ubi ex pauli verbis aperte liquet quisquis indigne panem hunc sumpserit reum esse corporis sanguinis domini aut si quis de calice biberit indigne similiter reum esse sanguinis corporis domini quod tamen nullo modo crimini daretur nisi seorsum sub specie panis esset corpus sanguis christi que itidem sub specie vini seorsum esset corpus sanguis christi nec disjunctim despecie panis locutus fuisset paulus si nunquam nisi conjunctim cum calice sumeretur ne que rursum disjunctim de calice dixisset si nunquam nisi conjunctim cum specie panis esset sumendus quorsum enim ea disjunxisset si nunquam nisi conjuncta esse possent verba ipsa scripturae singula sunt attendenda nam propheta inquit inclinate au em vestram verba oris mei moises deuteronimo ait ponite corda vestra omnia verba quae ego testificor vobis hodie quia non incassum praecepta sunt vobis et iterum non addetis ad verbum quod vobis loquor nec auferetis ab eo verba igitur domini atque ipsius pauli separatim de alterutra specie primum posita post utriusque conjunctionem etiam iterum disjuncta significare nobis videntur posse alterutram speciem seorsum porrigi secundum verbum christi nec per hoc quod christus dixit bibite ex hoc omnes statim consequetur christum jussisse communionem cuilibet de populo semper sub utra que specie nunquam sub altera dandam esse nam illorum verborum sensum non alium esse apparet quam quem ipse dominus apostolum suum paulum qui domino de hoc sacramento omnia se accepisse testatur edocuit nempe quod quotiescun que de calice hoc quisquam biberet id christi memoriam faceret sicuti fecerunt discipuli qui tunc aderant praesentes de eo biberunt omnes itaque quotiescunque sanguis christi bibendus quoquam esset memoria passio christi recordanda est sicut similiter quisquis corpus christi sumpserit ad memoriam passionem ejus revocare debet neque ex praecepto christi toties bibendum e e de hoc calice quotiescun que corpus christi sumendum est apparet per ea quae de verbis de exemplo christi supradicta sunt certe quicquid christus omnino observari praecepit non posse ulla humana sanctione prohiberi putamus cum humana lex divinam abolere non possit similiter etiam existimamus nec morem ullum nec ullam consuetudinem tantopere apud homines valere debere ut dei verbum expugnet christi praeceptum subvertat verumtamen cum christus nobis libere reliquerit ut eum tribus modis corporaliter sumere possimus quarto spiritualiter nempe primo sub utraque specie secundo sub panis specie tantum tertio sub vini quarto voluntate desiderio solo cum aliter necessitate coacti eum sumere nequimus existimamus pro primo ut si quis fidelis ardenti deum amore flagrans pietate que ingenti aestuans magnopere desideraret sacramentum sub utra que specie sumere si nullum vel valetudinis vel imbecillitatis obstaret impedimentum ei sub utra que specie communio praeberi possit dummodo ne que postulans ne que ministrans sacramentum scandalum populi aut contemptum ecclesiae id faciat neque suo jure leges regionis qua degit sive ecclesiasticas sive laicas infringere praesumat pro secundo tertio sic quod si impedimentum aliquod hujusmodi intervenit ut utraque specie ab que periculo sumi non possit ut si quis paralysi correptus aut ab alio quovis naturae aut morborum impedimento utram que speciem recipere commode non possit hic si desideret sacram communionem sumere ei sub altera tantum specie porrigatur pro quarto autem quod si quis nausea vel alia corporis molestia adeo sit infestatus ut nihil stomachus receptum non rejectet huic si id petat sacramentum saltem ostendi posset ut viso eo mortem christi redemptoris sui citius revocans memoriam compunctus corde spiritualiter communicet plurimum igitur demiror quod hi qui christianae libertatis assertores acerrimi propugnatores videri volunt libertatem hanc nostram hoc uno corporis sanguinis domini sacramento quo nihil superexcellentius nihil celebrius nihil incomparabilius nihil deni que ad consolandos idelium animos solidius christus hinc abiturus ecclesiae suae reliquit nobis tollere velint quid enim majus donare potuit christus hoc sacramento sumendum quam seipsum deinde cum ipse omnino liberum nobis reliquerit posse aliquos sub utra que specie communionem accipere posse alios sub altera nonnullos quo que morborum necessitate impeditos saltem conspectum prolato corpore domini compuncto corde posse spiritualiter communicare quantum immodestia quantum inclementia esset libertate hac fraudare christianos ut quibus sub utra que specie ob impedimenta quae sunt innumera communio praeberi non posset summi boni fruitione privatis sub neutra daretur nec adhuc fatentur etsi non corporaliter sumatur saltem spiritualiter capi posse qua non servitute durior esset haec conditio ut christi redemptoris nostri corpus quod ille fidelibus sumi voluit nobis id summopere desiderantibus violenter eripiatur quis ingenue christianus libertatem fruitionis hujus sibi extortam non omni morte intolerabiliorem putaret ita que libertas haec christo nobis relicta omni conatu retinenda est omnibus viribus amplectenda nec ipsis mea opinione fidendum e qui eam nobis tollere velint praeterea quid fiat apud septentrionales populos quid apud populos aphricae qui intra tropicos habitant apud quos non ea vini copia est ut populis omnino sub specie vini praeberi possit nam populis cervisia ex frugibus est potui ideo quia sub utra que specie ministrari sacramentum non potest ab utra que arcendi essent aut sub una non integrum christum capere possent id quod absit quando autem primum populus priscum morem deserere sub altera tantum panis specie communionem sacram sumere coepit nobis est incompertum credibile est majores nostros auctoritate scripturae motos quae alteram nonnunquam speciem per christum apostolos datam memorat propter periculum effusionis terram sanguinis christi cum liquida omnia levi membrorum trepidante motu facile effundantur religiosa quadam pia reverentia non mediocri que dei timore abstinuisse sacramento vini specie nec christum qui se cum ecclesia usque finem omnibus diebus mansurum promisit tot saeculis eam deseruisse ut si necessarium praeceptum de utra que specie semper ab omnibus sumenda dedisset tanti momenti eam permisisset turpiter labi sed magi ecclesiae suae liberum reliquisse videtur ut cum alterutra specie totus integer christus contineatur sub altera etiam sumi possit qui vero sit mo hodie de utra que specie ecclesiis graecis quae romanae ecclesiae tyrannidem nunquam admiserunt non satis nobis est compertum cum graecia tota turcarum subsit imperio nec liberam habeant facultatem christum ut libet profitendi quando nec verbum dei publice praedicare nec ad campanarum sonitum populum convocare nec publicas litanias crucis vexillo praeeunte facere ullo pacto est concessum illud quo que inprimis est observandum nempe quod universis ecclesiis die parasceves sacerdos omnis populus sub una tantum specie panis communicant non sub specie vini ut cum dy repraesentat mortem christi qua sanguis ejus pretiosus pro nostra salute effusus est separatus corpore separatim illo die sub altera solum specie communicarent omnes sive sacerdos sive populus qui mo per universam ecclesiam nunquam fuisset admissus nisi sub altera tantum specie integer christus contineretur que nisi sub altera sacramentum populis ministrari posset de missa privata per missas autem privatas multos abusus intoductos esse dicitis quas velut atlantem quendam papatum sustinuisse indulgentias invexisse orbem expilasse utpote

cum sacerdote communicant offerentes se anima suas hostias viva acceptabiles deo tametsi pauci fuerint que corporali sacramenti sumptione abstinuerint ac per hoc missa privata ecclesiae adeo non obest ut non parum ad vitam corrigendam ad fidem christum corroborandam prodesse videatur quippe christiani per hoe peccatores se agnoscunt quotidie delinquentes quotidie veniam postulant quotidie per peccatum salebroso vitae hujus cursu cadentes quotidie paenitentes resurgunt velut alacriores redditi devicto saepius hoste fiunt ad pugnam audentiores porro statim exordio omnis missae privatae

missa publica atque inter graecos ipsos ubi singulis dominicis diebus fit una missa publica uti asseritis raro admodum communicat esu sacramenti quisquam e populo uti fide dignis accepimus qui ipsi graecorum sacris interfuerunt quod vero epiphanium citatis qui singulis septimanis ter celebratam synaxim asia asserit eum que morem ab apostolis inductum cum jam tantum graecia singulis dominicis fiat populi conventus ad sacrum si mutari mo potuit ab apostolis inductus ut rarius quam statuerunt apos oli populus congregaretur cur non etiam mutari potuit ut saepius conveniret quando per hoc celebrior fit mortis christi memoria id quod missa sit etiam privata jam vero si sacramentum hoc fidelibus exerceri christus mortis suae memoriam praecepit inquiens hoc facite meam commemorationem ne mors ejus raro admodum commemorata oblivionem transiret quo crebrius quo frequentius memoria ejus sacramento repetitur eo mandatum ejus servatur magi etenim sicut raro admodum memorata oblivioni sunt obnoxia ita crebro frequentata radix mente agunt altius ne obliterari unquam possint ita que ut mors christi creb memoria illustretur missa etiam privata non parum confert certe paulus apostolus singulas domos privatas ubi credentium numerus aliquis erat ecclesias vocat membra majoris ecclesiae civitatis illius qua essent sicut majores ipsas civitatum ecclesias membra catholicae universalis ecclesiae appellat scribens ad corinthios quae ecclesia arcenda est communione corporis domini christus etiam ipse instituendo sacramentum hoc corporis sanguinis sui inquit hoc quotiescun que facitis facite meam commemorationem nec tempus nec locum ullum cohibuit quo fieri id non posset quonam modo igitur arcebimus quenquam missis privatis et ad dy festos publicam que synaxim eum relegabimus cujus arbitrio christus liberum reliquit quando ubi id vellet decenter exequi dum inquit quotiescunque nam si certa tempora servanda essent non indefinite locutus fuisset christus ipsum dei verbum ipsa sapientia patris jam vero ab initio nascentis ecclesiae per singulas domos ubi erant fideles fiebat communio que id quotidie teste luca apostolorum actis ubi ait quotidie quo que perdurantes unanimiter templo frangentes circa domos panem quem locum etiam de communione veteres interpretes intelligunt tamen singulis diebus non agebant publice dy festos sed privatim per domos communicabant etsi terrenorum regum que principum ministri pleri que omnes nullum diem transigere cupiunt quo non fruantur vel solo aspectu sui domini tametsi propior congressus non contingat quis fidelis christianus non omnibus optabit votis ut quando hac vita christum regem regum dominum dominantium majestate gloriae regnantem cernere mortales oculus non possunt saltem per fidem sacramento corporis domini quod ille fidelibus memoriam sui frequentandam reliquit interim quotidie regem gloriae videat quod vero chrysostomus sacerdotem ad altare stare aliosad communionem accersere alios arcere scribit enarrat morem publicae communionis qui initio nascentis ecclesiae crebrius quam nunc fit frequentabatur qui mo nunc paschate quando ubi que communicat populus apud omnes servatur ecclesias caeterum ille ipse expostulat cum fidelibus sui temporis quod rarius communicent quam vel oporteret vel vetus mo erat caeterum nusquam privatas missas vetuit canon nicenus diaconis communione publica suum locum designat post presbyteros caeterum nec canon nec ullus alius missas privatas abrogat sacramentum autem eucharistiae sacrificium non esse arbitramini quod unum sacrificium sit propitiatorium mors christi cum ultra non moritur qui semel tantum pro nobis oblatus est nullum restat ultra sacrificium nisi cultus spiritualis hoc est justitia fidei fructus fidei quid sibi velit justitia quae ex fide est scimus quippe quam paulus opponit justitiae quae est ex lege caeterum qui sunt fructus fidei nobis ex scripturis non satis liquet ipsam fidem sicut charitatem multas alias virtutes scimus esse fructus spiritus verum enimvero non satis miramur cur quispiam aegre ferat missam sacrificium vocari quando omnis vetustas graecorum latinorum sic eam appellare consuevit quum ibi fiat consecratio corporis sanguinis domini memoriam mortis ejus qui ut inquit paulus pro peccatis offerens hostiam sempiternum sedet ad dextram dei una enim oblatione consummavit sempiternum sanctificatos ita que si christus sacerdos esset sacrificium hostia ubicun que est christus ibi est hostia nostra ibi est sacrificium nostrum si sacramento altaris est verum corpus christi verus sanguis christi quo pacto manente veritate corporis sanguinis domini non est ibi sacrificium nostrum porro quia missa est christus sacrificium nostrum qui ipse ultra non moritur ibi que cum ipso capite nostro no illius corpus membra nosmet ipsos deo hostias viva offerimus graeci id totum nonlatin alphabet id est sacrificium incruentum vocant ita veteres omnes intrepide missam sacrificium vocarunt quod ibi sit christus sacrificium nostrum sacramento sic basilius sic chrysostomus sic hieronymus sic augustinus eam appellare non dubitavit quocirca quid vetat missam qua consecratur panis corpus christi vinum sanguinem ejus qui vere est sacrificium nostrum hoc fieri memoriam sui jussit vocari sacrificium alioqui si id negabimus non parum verendum est ne cum sacramentariis quos nunc vocant qui veritatem corporis sanguinis sacramento negant cum anabaptistis consentire videamur qua suspicione sicut animo nostro no profitemur longe abesse ita quo que cupimus calumniantibus adversariis omnem obtrectandi ansam auferri atqui cum missa tum sacerdos tum populus contritus de peccatis se ut hortatur paulus hostiam vivam sanctam que deo placentem exhibeat laudes quas deo canat gratiarum actione versetur quis dubitare potest ea quo que ratione missam jure sacrificium nominari cum propheta appellat sacrificium laudis paulus omnes hortetur ut se hostias viva exhibeant id quod fit missa malachias etiam propheta inquit ab ortu solis u que ad occasum magnum est nomen meum gentibus omni loco sacrificatur offertur nomini meo oblatio munda quia magnum est nomen meum gentibus dicit dominus exercituum quae alia oblatio munda omni loco intergentes nisi solus christus aut quod aliud sacrificium christianorum nisi missa ubi commemoratio mortis christi agitur nam aut aliquod inter gens christianorum oportet esse sacrificium aut mentitus est propheta quaenam quaeso est oblatio munda nisi solus christus hostia nostra qui sacramento altaris est sub panis vini speciebus quippe quantumcun que no ipsi no deo offeramus hostiae mundae non meremur nomen quorum omnis justitia velut pannus est menstruatae ita que constat missam sacrificium vocari ex verbo dei per malachiam enunciato quod cum ita sit cur missae invidemus nomen sacrificii quod propheta praedixit qua christus sacramento praesens est ipse mundi sacrificium de conjugio sacerdotum caelibatum sacerdotum contra scripturam contra leges naturae contra honestatem per pontificem romanum asseritis introductum cum scriptura sacerdotibus sicut caeteris hominibus conjugium permittat nec possint naturam suam mutare nec ab que singulari dono caelibes vivere nam non omnes capiunt verbum hoc paulus inquit propter fornicationem unusquis que uxorem suam habeat hic primum ordiri juvat ut locum illum evangelii de tribus eunuchorum generibus consideremus quandoquidem christus alios natura eunuchos esse asserit alios per vim factos quorum neutrum genus continentiae virtute splendet quoniam alteros ad generandum natura alteros violentia reddidit inutiles tertium vero genus eorum est qui quanquam terrena generatione uti possunt malunt continere se castrare propter regnum coelorum de quo genere christus statim infert qui potest capere capiat id quod nec de primo nec de secundo eunuchorum genere intelligi potest quibus continentiae palma negata est cum descendere certamen nequeunt tertium vero genus eorum est qui continentiae student licitis nuptiis abstinere malunt propter regnum coelorum quo christum liberius que expeditius sequantur ne terrenis nuptiis implicati cogitare cogantur ut inquit paulus quae sunt mundi ad quod genus christus virginitatis autor homines sapientissime invitat inquiens qui potest capere capiat per hoc quod inquit capiat homines adhortans ad capescendum certamen ut palmam arripiant nempe regnum coelorum ad quod neminem hortaretur si nemo carnem posset vincere per hoc vero quod ait qui potest capere posse capi palmam indicans alioqui si impossible esset carnem superare quorsum attineret dicere qui potest si nemo id posset praeterea per ea verba qui potest capere quosdam etiam esse declarat qui non facile possunt nam nisi aliqui non facile possent capere cur secerneret eos qui possunt ita que considerandas animi vires admonet priusquam certamen aggrediare ne temere arrepto certamine turpiter succumbas nec dixisset quosdam esse qui se castraverunt propter regnum coelorum si caro esset insuperabilis nemo se castrare posset nec dubitandum est quin qui hortatur ad subeundum certamen gratiam suam sine qua nihil possent non defuturam demonstrat qui nomina sua militiam ei dederunt quorum ille ipse dux futurus est qui non modo periculis suos milites invocatus nunquam deserit sed stat ante januam pulsat paratus semper ad succurrendum si quis ei aper nam paulus tentationes superari posse no admonet modo dei auxilium imploremus inquiens tentatio vos non apprehendit nisi humana fidelis autem deus qui non patietur vos tentari supra id quod potestis sed faciet etiam cum tentatione proventum ut possitis sustinere quamobrem qui continentiam semel profitentur eam postea turpiter deserunt tiam que etiam considerandum est ne nomen dei blasphemare videantur christum accusantes deserti auxilii cum sint ipsi desertores militiae primo statim congressu terga dante hosti ita que quod paulus liberum cui que acit ut propter fornicationem uxorem suam habeat id de intelligi qui continentiam non sunt professi paulus ipse no docet inquiens de viduis adolescentioribus quae cum luxuriatae fuerunt christo nubere volunt habentes damnationem quia primam fidem irritam feceru augustinus pauli doctrinam secutus psal inquit alius ex dei muner majus aliquid vovit statuit nec nuptias pati qui non damnaretur si duxisset uxorem post votum quod deo promisit si duxerit damnabitur sic virgo quae si nuberet non peccaret sanctimonialis si nupserit christi adultera reputabitur respexit enim retro de loco quo accesserat exemplo uxoris loth sicut canis reversus ad vomitum reputatur itidem augustinus psal ample asserit votum semel emissum servandum esse hieronymus etiam adversus jovinianum inquit virgo quae se deo dicavit si nubat damnationem habet que alio loco adversus eundem virgines tuae quas prudentissimo consilio quod nemo unquam legerat nec audierat de apostolo docuisti melius esse nubere quam uri occultos adulteros apertos verterunt maritos non suasit hoc apostolus non electionis va virgilianum consilium est conjugium vocat hoc praetexit nomine culpam verbum ipsum dei palam adversatur ubique ne rumpantur vota propheta inquit vovete reddite domino deo vestro deuteronomio quo que scribitur cum votum voveris domino deo tuo non tardabis reddere quia requiret illud dominus deus tuus si moratus fueris reputabitur tibi peccatum si nolueris polliceri ab que peccato eris quod autem egressum est de labiis tuis observabis facies sicut promisisti domino deo tuo propria voluntate ore locutus e ecclesiastes etiam inquit si quid vovisti ne moreris reddere sed quodcun que voveris redde et numerorum libro scribitur si quis virorum votum domino voverit aut se constrinxerit juramento non faciat irritum verbum suum sed omne quod promisit implebit quocirca ecclesia principio sicut conjugatos sacerdotes episcopos qui sine crimine essent unius uxoris viri propter necessitatem admisit cum tot alii quot possent ad edocendum orbem sufficere tunc non reperirentur idonei tamen paulus ipse timotheum caelibem elegit ita quo que si quis ad sacerdotium caelebs accersitus postea uxorem duxerit semper sacerdotio deponebatur secundum canonem neocaesariensis concilii quod fuit ante nicenum similiter calcedonensi concilio cujus primo capite priora concilia confirmantur statuitur ut diaconissa si se nuptiis tradat maneat sub anathemate virgo deo dicata monachus jungentes se nuptiis maneant excommunicati hoc quo que observandum est quod canonibus apostolorum habetur tantummodo lectores cantores que non conjugatos posse uxores ducere caeteris vero clerum admissis postea uxorem ducere nunquam licuit qui vero conjugati ad sacerdotium admissi erant uxores suas praetextu religionis abjicere nequaquam poterant ut docet canon apostolicus cumque niceno concilio proponeretur de presbyterorum jam ductis uxoribus abjiciendis restitit paphnutius ne legitimae uxores pellerentur cujus sententiam cum canone apostolorum de non abjiciendis uxoribus concordantem omnes sunt secuti caeterum niceno concilio nihil unquam propositum fuit ut sacerdotes post sacerdotium uxores ducerent quod jam ante sic erit prohibitum ut si quis contrarium auderet ducens postea uxorem deponeretur sacerdotio ut supra dictum est ita que paphnutius de non abjiciendis jam ductis ante sacerdotium uxoribus non autem de ducendis post sacerdotium aperte locutus est ita que ne que canon aliquis apostolicus ne que concilium nicenum quicquam habet ejusmodi ut sacerdotium admissi postea uxores ducant sicuti vos allegatis concordat sexta synodus qua sancitum est quod si quis e clero vellet uxorem ducere ante subdiaconatum id faceret postea nequaquam liceret nec ulla usquam libertas sacerdotibus sexta synodo datur post sacerdotium uxores ducendi sicut vos asseritis ita que principio nascentis ecclesiae plane compertum est nullo unquam tempore licuisse sacerdoti post sacerdotium uxorem ducere que ubicun que id fuit attentatum id non fuit impune nam tantum nefas ausus deponebatur sacerdotio paulus apostolus inquit de conjugibus loquens nolite fraudare invicem nisi forte ex consensu ad tempus ut vacetis orationi hieronymus apologia ad pammachium ait paulus apostolus dicit quando coimus cum uxoribus no orare non posse si per coitum quod minus est impeditur id est orare quanto plus quod majus est id est corpus christi prohibetur accipere idque late prosequitur exemplo panum propositionis qui non dabantur nisi continen bus davidi ministris ut scribitur libro regum pane enim propositionis quasi corpus christi de uxorum cubilibus consurgentes edere non poterant ut inquit hieronymus atque exemplo dationis legis veteris ante cujus dationem filii israel exodo triduo abstinere sunt jussi ab uxoribus hieronimus etiam adversus jovinianum inquit si laicus quicun que fidelis orare non potest nisi careat officio conjugali sacerdoti cui semper pro populo offerenda sunt sacrificia semper orandum est si semper orandum est semper ergo carenduum matrimonio idem asserit ambrosius ample epistola ad timotheum prima cum quo consentit augustinus paulus timotheum discipulum sacerdotali officio erudiens admonet secularia negotia fugienda esse inquiens labora ut bonus mile christi iesu nemo militans implicat se negotiis secularibus ut ei placeat cui se probavit si sacerdotes uxores acciperent curis secularibus necesse est involvantur nam teste paulo qui cum uxore est solicitus est quae sunt mundi quomodo placeat uxori qui vero sine uxore est solicitus est quae domini sunt quomodo placeat deo ideo que eundem ad caelibatum hortatur quando ait teipsum castum custodi nam castitas ubi de conjugatis non fit sermo caelibatus intelligitur suum enim discipulum sui similem reddere cupiebat atque quodam loco corinthiis scribens omnes homines hortatur ad continentiam ait enim volo omnes homines esse sicut meipsum rursus dico nonnuptis viduis bonum est si sic permanserint sicut ego alio loco scribens eisdem ministros ecclesiae sui officii admonet adhortans ne vacuum gratiam dei recipiant subdit nemini dante ullam offensionem ut non vituperetur ministerium sed omnibus exhibeamus nosmetipsos sicut dei ministros c vigiliis jejuniis castitate scientia verbo veritatis quae omnia ad ministros ecclesiae pertinent quos castitatem maxime sectari convenit ut impuri non appropinquent altaribus quibus alaces omnino arceri decet nam non nisi de sacerdotibus ea intelligi possunt quando scientia divinae legis populi institutio ad eos spectat ut inquit malachias labium sacerdotis custodiunt scientiam legem requirunt ex ore ejus et paulus timotheum vult se exhibere operarium inconfusibilem recte tractantem verbum veritatis viz doctrina populi igitur sacerdotes domini qui se deo jampridem dedicaverunt qui se castraverunt propter regnum coelorum qui pro suis populi peccatis orare assidue debent quonam pacto deserto caelibatus vexillifero christo novis nuptiis operam dare secularibus que molestiis quibus scaturiunt se implicare decet quid enim est ad aratrum manum mittere retro que recipere exemplo uxoris loth si hoc non est cujusmodi homines non aptos esse regno dei christus ipse pronunciat etenim si nemo potest uxori pariter philosophiae operam dare ut mundana prudentia docet quanto magi qui se deo dicavit duobus dominis servir non poterit nempe deo pariter mundo quorum uter que totum hominem non dimidiatum ad se raptat quanquam autem conjugati caelibes initio ecclesiae admittebantur ad sacerdotium id tamen non ubi que ita servabatur teste hieronymo adversus vigilantium ubi inquit quid facient orientis ecclesiae quid egypti sedis apostolicae quae aut virgines clericos accipiunt aut continentes aut si uxores habuerint mariti esse desistunt atque ad pammachium hieronymus inquit christus virgo virgo maria utrius que sexus virginitatem dedicaverunt apostoli vel virgines vel post nuptias continentes episcopi presbyteri diaconi aut virgines eliguntur aut vidui aut certe post sacerdotium aeternum pudici morem ecclesiae veterem cujus autor est haud dubie paulus scriptura ipsa jam vero uti augustinum citatis qui ait quidam nubentes post votum asserunt adulteros esse ego dico vobis quod graviter peccant qui tale dividunt ille ipse augustinus asserit lapsus ruinas castitate sanctiori quae vovetur deo adulteriis esse pejores ne que statim legitimum est quicquid tolerat ecclesia cyprianus quo que ipse quem citatis illa ipsa epistola de virginibus quae continentiam voverunt ubi inquit si perseverare nolunt vel non possint melius est ut nubant quam ut ignem delitiis suis ruant ex quo infertis tale votum non impedire matrimonium longe aliud sentit nam consultus pomponio sacerdote quid sibi videretur de virginibus quae cum semel statum suum continenter firmiter tenere decreverint detectae sunt postea eodem lecto pariter mansisse cum masculis ea de altius repetens sermonem periculosam que esse virginum masculorum cohabitationem confirmans per scripturas ac graf multorum ruinas ex hoc enatas asserens generaliter de omnibus virginibus inquit quod si ex fide christo se dicaverint caste pudice sine ulla fabula perseverent ita fortes stabile praemium virginitatis expectent si autem perseverare nolunt vel non possunt melius est ut nubant quam ut ignem delitiis suis cadant certe nullum fratribus aut sororibus scandalum faciant cum scriptum sit c et paulo post infert christus dominus judex noster cum virginem suam sibi dicatam sanctitati suae destinatam jacere cum altero cernat quam indignatur ira itur quas paenas incestis hujusmodi conjunctionibus comminatur deinde ad quaesitum respondens jubet obstetrices adhiberi ut videatur virgines illae sint corruptae ubi inquit si autem aliquae ex ei corruptae fuerunt deprehensae agant poenitentiam plenam quia quae hoc crimen admisit non mariti sed christi adultera est ideo aestimato justo tempore ex homologesi facta ad ecclesiam redeant quod si obstinatae perseverent nec se ab invicem separent sciant se um hac sua impudica obstinatione nunquam nobis admitti ecclesiam posse ne exemplum caeteris ad ruinam delictis suis facere incipiant ecce quid sentit cyprianus de votis ruptis incestuosos christi adulteros hujusmodi flagitiosos appellat nisi separentur nunquam admittit ecclesiam quomodo ergo talia vota non impediant matrimonium aut quis ad tale matrimonium quenquam hortari audebit quod sine violatione voti transgressione divini mandati ideo que sine gravissimo elere contrahi non possit atqui quod principe germaniae scribitis cum viderent mul flagitia de coelibatu sacerdotum provenire matrimonia sacerdotibus libera permisisse si meum egregii oratores consilium requisissent vestri priusquam tot sacerdotes apud vos inculis ad nuptias id consilii dedissem quod vestri arripuerunt nam
