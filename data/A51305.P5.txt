magnum fuisse discrimen dignitatis inter timotheum presbyterum atque alios qui tum etiam appellati erant presbyteri fuit ille ea dignitate praeditus quam jam tota ecclesia episcopalem vocat quae data

se rem habuisse apostolorum aevo intellexit eundem enim tunc fuisse presbyterum episcopum commentariis ad titum scripsit presbyteros quoque habuisse ordinandi potestatem quia presbyteri id erant quod episcopi idem est ergo inquit presbyter qui episcopus antequam diaboli instinctu studia religione fierent diceretur populis ego sum pauli ego apollo ego autem cephae communi presbyterorum consilio

postquam unusquisque eos quos baptizaverat suos putabat esse non christi toto orbe decretum est ut unus de presbyteris electus superponeretur caeteris ad quem omnis ecclesiae cura pertineret schismatum semina tollerentur post apostolorum itaque tempore hoc decretum toto orbe factum est resp no minime negamus quin ad reprimenda schismata necesse fuerit ut episcopi plus auctoritatis exercerent atque inde distinctio dignitatis episcopalis presbyteralis clarius apparuit communi presbyterorum consilio ecclesiae gubernabantur antequam inter ipsos presbyteros orta sint dissidia tunc necesse erat ut ille presbyter qui ordinandi potestatem habebat atque hac ratione caeteris praestabat jurisdictionem quandam exerceret ad reprimenda schismata notandum est quod ipse agnoscat heronymus inceptam fuisse hanc consuetudinem temporibus apostolorum nempe cum diceretur populis ego sum pauli ego apollo ego autem cephae hac ipsa epistola qua ista occurrunt verba quid facit excepta ordinatione episcopus quod presbyter non faciat sic ille loquitur ut sciamus traditione apostolicas sumptas de vetere testamento quod aaron filii ejus atque levitae templo fuerunt hoc sibi episcopi presbyteri diaconi vendicent ecclesia hinc omnibus innotescat quamsit veritati inimicus adversarius noster qui ausus est hanc vox proferre ad morem jusque suae aetatis respexit sed non ita rem

ecclesiae constitutione consuetudine descendere clare dicit cum ob ecclesiae honorem id constitutum significat quo salvo pacem salvam esse ait simul etiam inducans eandem causam fecisse ut episcopus

maluerit quam hypothesi servire utinam omnes qui prae se ferunt ultimam schismatum aversationem hoc studio ducerentur ut episcopus ubi que sit presbyteris praepositus quod olim hanc ob rationem

optimum ratio fuerit ita instituendi nunc cum reipsa cognoscitur ex episcopali tyrannide certius ecclesia malum ac damnum majus oriri quam quod ex aemulatione aequalium metuebatur quod bona de causa constitutum fuerat meliore posse imo debere abrogari quis non videt quo judice qua auctoritate id debet abrogari quod tota ecclesia erat constitutum ad schismata tollenda quibus nullum ecclesia majus

reprimenda est non armis phanaticis concionibus clamoribus omnimodo furore miscenda sunt omnia illis regnis quibus perhibentur episcopi tyrannidem exercere p curationem solam habuerunt primo episcopi qui iidem presbyteri sine potestate sine imperio sine jurisdictione fals ssimum est scripturae manifeste contrarium primo episcopos nullam habuisse potestatem nullam jurisdictionem certo certius est aliquam illos habere potestatem quibus aliqua debita est obedientia heb obedite praepositis vestris inquit apostolus heu quantos errores quot opinionum portenta fomenta ista scelerum orbem christianum

hujus rei exemplum cernimus controversia istade distinctione ordinis episcopalis presbyterali tam fervide agitata scilicet hanc litem ad horrenda intereptos christianos pacificum nomen certamina provexit non magna aliqua presbyterianorum sententiae verisimilitudo ad alliciendos hominum mentes idonea sed convenientia ista quae illo dogmate est cum nativa generis humani nequitia unde nimirum omnia oriuntur semina pervicacitatis ac superbiae cujus indoles hujusmodi est ut auctoritati universum semper refragetur praesertim ecclesiasticae degeneres animos arguit homines generosos dignitate

extat tota rerum natura nihil esse aestimandum nisi quantum spectat ad ecclesiam qui gubernant ecclesiam auctoritate exercenda humilitatem vere christianam maxime conspicuam exhibeant ad reprimendam hujus saeculi superbiam certe auctoritatis christo derivatae nunquam poterint plenam exerere efficaciam nisi cum seipsos ostenderint magistri opt max sequaces qui dicit si quis vult post venire abdicet semetipsum attollat crucem suam quotidie sequatur nonlatin alphabet blondellus apologia pro sententia hieronymi de episcopis presbyteris p haec verba habet consuetudo illa non ex quo primum inter corinthios auditum fuit go sum pauli c sed paulatim invaluit quod adversus eos diligentius notandum venit quos hieronymianae phrase nudo cortici eo sine inhaerere mordicus juvat quo liberius clarissimi scriptoris mente aberrare sinantur resp eundem esse sensum quem no asseremus hieronymianae phrase extra omnem controversiam ponitur per haec ipsa hieronymi verba eadem epistola ad evagrium qua phrasis ista occurrit ut sciamus traditiones apostolicas sumptas de vetere testamento quod aaron filii ejus que levitae templo fuerunt hoc sibi episcopi presbyteri diaconi vendicent ecclesia p quoscun que spiritus sanctus episcopos pascere ecclesiam attendere gregi c ii veri nominis ac dicti nonlatin alphabet episcopi consendi sunt quid enim aliud praestare suum putent quos nunc nonlatin alphabet episcopos vocamus nonlatin alphabet dicti nonlatin alphabet episcopi est ut sit potestate ordinandi constitutus quod ne quaquam commune est illi cum aliis presbyteris p nihil hieronymi seculo fecit episcopus excepta ordinatione quod non faceret presbyter manifestum est sanctum hieronymum hisce verbis excepta ordinatione non sua tantum tempora respexisse sed etiam apostolica namque asserit secundum traditiones apostolicas ut constat ex verbis supra recitatis ecclesia episcopum tam certo fuisse presbytero superiorem quam templo aaronem filiis suis levitis p licet ecclesiastico jure non omnis presbyter episcopus sit episcopi presbyteri una ordinatio est adeo que idem nonlatin alphabet sive enim per ordinationem consecrationis ritum nonlatin alphabet sive munus ipsum ad quod nonlatin alphabet destinatur consecratus intelligere placeat perinde est siquidem quorum eadem est generatio seu actus quo forma introducitur eorum eadem est forma quae dat esse rei quorum eadem est functio eorum eadem est potestas nonlatin alphabet forma manans resp quanquam isto respectu episcopi presbyteri eadem ordinatio est quod ordinatione episcopi includatur presbyteri ordinatio adeo ut eum qui ordine episcopali est constitutus collata sit potestas ea omnia faciendi quae presbyter faciat hoc tamen respectu diversa est eorum ordinatio quod per ordinationem presbyteri non sit ipsum collata potestas alios ordinandi quae solo reservatur episcopo semper excipienda ab ea potestate quaecun que presbytero tribuitur proculdubio quorum eadem est functio eorum eadem est potestas sed pernegamus eandem esse ex omni parte episcopi presbyteri functionem p interiacens aetate sua inter sacerdotes nonlatin alphabet chrysostomus ob oculos habebat resp chrysostomus hanc reddidi rationem cur paulus apostolus epistola ad timotheum nullam faceret mentionem simplicium presbyterorum sed immediate transiret ab episcopis ad diaconos nempe quia non alio dignitatis discrimine episcopi distabant presbyteris nisi sola ordinandi potestate nonlatin alphabet istiusmodi sophistae qui audet asserere chrysostomum hoc loco suam tantum non apostolorum aetatem respexisse ejusdem farinae sunt ea omnia quae ostentator iste multifariae immensae lectionis ad lassandum potius quam satiandum lectoris studium exprompsit scilicet speciem ingentis literaturae non falsam praefertur opinionem falsam inducat quam plurimos eorum qui solent famam scriptoris potius quam ipsam rem scriptam inquirere praesertim si valde velint id verum haberi cui speciem veritatis affingunt celeberrimi scriptores cum igitur nullo versemur dubio quin plurimos eorum qui aussi sint asserere presbyteros potestatem habere presbyteros ordinandi errorem istum potius induxerint perversae voluntatis indomitae vires qnam aliqua
