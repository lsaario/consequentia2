seventh letter concerning sacred trinity occasioned second letter w iohn wallis professor geometry oxford london printed tho parkhurst bible three crown cheapside seventh letter concerning sacred trinity postscript sixth letter printed came seems late sheet printed gave notice received london night march another letter w like import former somewhat fuller directly concern expression thanks respect approbation knew otherwise way return acknowledgment neither signifie writes know london who name letter w belong reflection expression learned author expression see engaged defend therefore wave say three divine person three intelligent being three substantial being three spirit really distinct though mutually conscious think learned author needed said think safe le positive particular scripture leaf dark answer think would le valid undertakes answer though expression omitted forbear publish letter without order loth engage learned writer thereof publick dispute learned author unless please since time considering postscript came late printed letter mine letter reverend divine take content seems penned care caution willing publick without intimation dislike published former letter like circumstance thought amiss unagreeable mind publish also followeth supplying date postmark london denoting day givenin postoffice reverend dr wallis professor geometry oxford london march sir repeated letter give occasion repeating hearty thanks hope give leave join good wish endeavour promote moderation seem aim stating mysterious truth concerning trinity methinks might easily perswaded difficulty men find conceiving mystery especially consequence make impose upon u certain sacred truth sir would lose little time may reading letter enter immediately upon subject proposed consider lesser nicety two main point doctrine trinity difficulty vnderstandings represent u conception two main point unity godhead notwithstanding distinction three person equality three person notwithstanding derivation one another concerning divine person hypothesis referred formerly shall still follow asserts three thing first three being three intelligent being really distinct secondly three substantial being really distinct thirdly three infinite mind three holy spirit really distinct think may course add fourth character three compleat being really distinct inadequate partial being spirit infinite perfection represented want nothing compleat perfection let u please run character observe obvious difficulty occurr mind conception first three being really distinct according plain tract humane reason every real hath essence basis stand upon distinguished nonentity fictitious every distinct hath distinct essence mean numerically distinct therefore according principle ought three distinct essence godhead seeing three being really distinct furthermore give one single essence three being really distinct must either divide multiply either being must piece essence divide must whole one whole cannot give three without multiplying still made difficult conceive author allows three distinct peter james john distinct peter james john one peter james john every degree distinction take away degree vnity every degree heat take away degree cold proceed second character three divine person three substantial being really distinct plain english three substance really distinct spiritual spirit corporeal body substantial substance putting onely two word one author must understand make three spirit afterwards therefore must three substance besides pray substance cannot mode bare relation know platonist call supersubstances think lower call semisubstances philosopher substantial form playing word nothing represented faculty substance mode relation excepting meerly notional learned author must debar u use word substance pretence sound corporeally two creed make use scripture self upon fair interpretation heb proceed therefore three substance really distinct whereof god pag l p l yet one god hard conceive contrary idea number numeration ti true may conceive three substance strict vnion one another notwithstanding real distinction union one thing unity another vnity excludes plurality multiplicity vnion doth rather supposes vnity also simple nature excludes composition vnion contrary always implies one kind accordingly substance upon vnion confounded identified brought vnity substance continuing numerically distinct substance acquire community communication operation namely action passion respectively capable let u consider instance thing chief union known u soul body two substance really distinct close vnion one another notwithstanding continue distinct substance vnion like manner humane soul christ vnion logo second person trinity call hypostatical union neither doth vnion make vnity substance two substance divine humane nature continue distinct vnion must allowed vnity godhead plurality multiplicity substance learned author acknowledge p three substance separate would three god inseparate inseparable make one uneasy conceive substance really distinct separable notion substance may subsist self mark separability real distinction thing modally notionally distinct allow cannot subsist separate really distinct substance may separated really proved real distinction soul body two substance think sufficient ground assert separability soul body reason assert part matter separable really distinct substance let vnion otherwise faculty true thing clearly conceive really distinct ut re re may possibly separated clear distinct conception u rule partibility however suppose please vnion indissoluble change vnity soul man made perpetual conjunction matter platonist affirm doth make matter soul one substance matter cease matter soul spirit suppose three divine substance indissoluble vnion doth make cease three substance make three substance indissoluble vnion learned authour say concerning matter extension may returned upon reference godhead p l supposes extension consist part assignable part whether divided say according opinion godhead may consist several substance assignable substance whether divided may distinctly assign vnderstanding three substance godhead father son holy ghost may assign three part physical atome b c lastly substance lost destroyed vnion dissoluble indissoluble therefore substance whether conjunction separation come unto third character pag see also p three divine person three infinite mind three holy spirit yet one god rise still higher former vnconceivableness seems say unsay thing breath infinite spirit compleatly god essence attribute therefore three three god omnis men infinite perfecta est deus tres sunt mentes infinite perfectae ergo tres sunt dii fourth syllogism character seems assert three infinite whereas athanasian creed stand highest pitch yet tender cautious giving number three thing person allow three eternals three incomprehensibles three almighty three infinite include infinite spirit said god mean infinite perfection authour doth three spirit whereof infinite perfection three god three creature whereof rational animal three men proposition go upon ground namely definition thing defined reciprocal extent better definition man rational animal neither better definition god spirit infinitely perfect many animal rational many men likewise many spirit infinitely perfect many god speak according use faculty true precise state thing question concerning infinite nature presume determine thus much think may safely determine case faculty loss safest way keep close revelation word scripture thats conclusion drive lastly put plain question come every one mind three spirit infinitely perfect either god creature must one two speak spirit infinitely perfect describe absolute compleat entire must denomination either god creature know nothing middle nature betwixt possibly answer distinction namely three god considered separately considered collectively vnion one god seeing cannot really separate would improper call three god pray properly three god three infinite spirit seeing term spirit infinitely perfect god term equivalent identical partiality allow one infinite spirit inseparable grant number three name name god seeing thing equally inseparable observed learned authour liberal three three intelligent being three infinite mind three holy spirit three divine glory three majesty three king ti name seems scrupled rather thing sir add upon head consider grand principle designed take difficulty mutual consciousness whereby three made one reduced perfect numerical unity need spend time telling author mean mutual consciousness applies present case know sufficiently methinks vnitive principle defectively expressed word consciousness bare consciousness without consent bare omnisciency god conscious thought good bad devil thought without vnion without consent good bad angel made mutually conscious one anothers mind would thereupon become one still different will inclination may author say consciousness involves consent say knowledge involves power besides cannot well reconcile author point see p l compared p given instance former letter contrary may add please consideration knowledge thing power actual conception thing actual execution may sit quietly study thought pen build palace take town city know method distinctly conceive delineate thing u neither conceive respect god eternity god clear idea frame world manner producing therefore god conception knowledge power world produced eternity proceed let u give principle full strength consciousness consent would together make perfect vnity operation deity much le substance noted vnity vnion different thing apparent three spirit united one done without sort composition unconceivable mystery may indeed conceive three spirit singly separately simple being conceive three simple being united one without annihilation one one must compound according conception vnity operation besides energy peculiar father son author allows p every one three mind notwithstanding vnion hath distinct consciousness common two therefore godhead consists three mind cannot one single mind one intire community sameness consciousness operation opinion hypothesis prest speak plain language would three divine substance three holy spirit infinitely perfect truth reality three god reason fit called three being similitude nature mutual consciousness consent cooperation greatest vnion possible state vnion constitute nonlatin alphabet intire comprehensive godhead confess book something like conceivable thing christian trinity use represented thus amount kind hypostatical vnion three divine spirit sir trouble upon first general head distinction person proceed consider equality person dispatch word first argument equality may pag l c father nonlatin alphabet selfexisten selforiginated whereas two nonlatin alphabet existent originated another cannot make according faculty difference also inequality ti fundamental perfection selforiginated equal say possibly though son holyghost produced father yet ti way creature produced voluntary external act internal necessary emanative act allow distinction admit son holyghost different origin common creature remove difficulty shews indeed great difference inequality betwixt divine person bare creature shew equality amongst divine person ti true dependance creature hath upon creator another kind degree son holyghost however derivative being way dependent upon father cannot conceive inequality betwixt original derivative dependent independent secondly act whereby son generated father energy perfection nay ti energy highest perfection result perfect way produced noblest greatest product thing creation energy produceth creature hath term effect noble great energy whereby son generated consequently great perfection create world generate divine logo see selforigination father son also active perfection highest degree possible one therefore cannot either respect conceive two being equal besides make three equal infinite coordinate mean internally perfection nature external subordination oeconomy signifies nothing case one three individual specie one peter james john may one think doctrine tritheites near lastly may please reflect upon various sentiment expression ancient concerning dignity preheminence father know noted petavius de trin lib c l c s consider consistency inconsistency perfect equality sir write disrespect treatise contains many excellent thing neither represent absolute truth vntruth difficulty conceiving thing infinite nature consideration would willingly infer two conclusion first ought keep close scripture mysterious doctrine secondly impose consequence humanely made rigour divinely revealed truth antitrinitarian system suited genius yet would stretch trinitarian doctrine far set distance scripture well reason secret thing belong unto lord thing revealed belong u child deut angel may think u foolish ridiculous pursuing notion think self wise learned pursuit sir sincerity humble servant w letter reply followeth reverend w j sir obliged kind respectful character pleased afford letter displeased thank like moderation commend letter mysterious truth concerning sacred trinity fully close say conclusion angel may think u foolish ridiculous pursuing notion revealed think self wise learned pursuit like laugh blind man never seen undertake conceive mind express u word distinct perfect notion idea sight light colour may hear noise sound three word supposing though blind deaf also may believe signifie somewhat somewhat cannot tell never idea thereof mind perception thereof sens notion self would explain could otherwise use word sense analogical properly belong somewhat hath experience idea sight might say certain kind sense feeling eye hand foot part body

whatever hand might shape formed wood stone different motion possible blind man idea notion fancy sight light colour see much impossible u notion mind derive mediately immediately sensible impression finite corporeal being clear perfect notion nature unity distinction attribute infinite spiritual otherwise express imperfect analogy resemblance thing conversant word borrowed sense therefore fully agree two conclusion namely safe prudent keep close scripture mysterious doctrine since know nothing otherwise revealed impose consequence humane deduction like rigour divinelyrevealed truth even common affair thing represented onely analogy resemblance bear thing seldom similitude absolute dissimilitude likewise much distance great finite corporeal being infinite incorporeal cannot always argue cogently one therefore word nature essence vnity distinction father son person beget proceed like applied god borrowed sense properly signifie applied creature must supposed signifie somewhat analogous primary signification consequence thence deduced rigour would mere cavilling argue knowledge strength separable man therefore god call name god consequently may possible allwise god almighty almighty god allwise argue manner locality duration god vbiquity without extension eternity without succession inference must need lame inconsequent inference like nature even without proceeding infinite suppose spirit soul man void part local extension therefore phrase tota toto tota qualibet parte space matter compresent yet argue like case one single spirit compresent three reallydistinct part space matter must divide multiply either extensive part must piece spirit divide must whole one whole cannot give without multiplying inference upon supposition supposition loth think impossible must need lame yet commonly cavil study pick quarrel doctrine trinity delivered scripture particular though amongst men three person sometimes always used import three men may thence conclude three divine person must need imply three god word person please though think fit word case spare word without prejudice cause ti notion rather name contend content self say three somewhats one god may explain self three person mean three somewhats inconsistent one god hitherto suppose well enough agree observe concerning learned author dr sherlock shall begin end agree treatise refer contains many excellent thing strength weight argument undertakes answer doth depend upon expression object argument equal force though expression spared expression noted three divine person three being three intelligent being three substantial being three holy spirit really distinct even distinct peter iames iohn one god onely mutually conscious confess unsatisfied therein first looking upon expression hardy one venture upon find others discoursed wish declined yet think necessary write though like chose rather wave express self otherwise would endless make business write book every one hath expression cannot approve amongst many others wherein think doth well shall aggravate objection urged leave might perhaps mollifie expression putting softer sense upon first view seem bear find men matter use word different rate others book hand read good since first came therefore willing say much without book least miss sense perform mind learned author may think fit vindicate explain expression shall judge convenient may rather decline without prejudice main cause opinion may well defend without thereby le expose cavil antitrinitarians catching every colourable pretence objecting though main cause concerning trinity expression maintain thus far think u agree namely distinction three meerly notional even commonly call divine attribute yet three god god one much need maintain antitrinitarians word person unfit name denote distinction thus far may close notwithstanding inconvenient expression agreed three thus distinguished one god communicating one numerical essence equal common internal essence common attribute thereof external subordination oeconomy grant signifies nothing case sir look back upon discourse find whole edge argument directed expression three being three substance three spirit acknowledge argument seem sharp enough work instead say think three person one one substance one spirit like say one god edge taken augustin epist spiritus est deus pater spiritus est filius ipse spiritus sanctus nec tamen tres spiritus sed vnus spiritus sicut non tres dii sed vnus deus conceive impose upon point forced sense language sometimes put upon word person want another english word answering homo might indifferently respect man woman child like forced sense put schoolman upon word persona want latin word might equally relate men angel signifying intelligent whence induced think three person must need three intelligent being whereas persona true ancient sense schoolman put forced sense upon signify man simply one circumstance qualification man capable qualified thus thus thus might sustain three person three person man say elsewhere like case taken fool yet wise man may sometimes upon second thought see reason change opinion case rectify expression consider much easier le obnoxious exception maintain hypothesis thus rectified may think done ill office thus suggest thus given thought hypothesis press self tell degree distinction metaphysicks wont reckoned take three divine person think need much trouble self nicety tell ex abundanti doth much concern main question hand safe enough without prescribe therein require others express sentiment degree distinction commonly mentioned metaphysicks distinctio rationis ratiocinantis purely notional depends meerly imagination destinatio rationis ratiocinatae otherwise said secundum inadaequatos conceptus ejusdem rei distinctio modalis either ut re modus ut modus modus otherwise said ex parte rei sed non ut re re distinctio realis ut re re though name several degree writer always speak alike one perhaps distinction ex parte rei may mean another mean distinctio realis rest thus marshalled contrivance might ought know made fewer contriver thought fit degree distinction take primarily fitted notion created being intended applicable god otherwise analogy word properly fitted created being wont applied therefore choose say strictness speech metaphysicks yet given name distinction know need divine attribute use say distinguished ratione ratiocinata inadaequati conceptus ejusdem rei well enough say mind captious willing understand figurative word figurative sense mind cavil would speak cautiously say god somewhat analogous call created being divine person somewhat analogous deity created being called distinctio modalis distinctio parte rei sed non ut re re asked distinction thus analogous say cannot tell must first tell enable comprehend full adaequate import word father son beget proceed c applied god sense analogous signify created being cannot tell precisely tell differ need trouble self nicety name degree distinction done diver men diversly expressed think enough say distinction greater call divine attribute make three god three yet one god content rest sir serve youi wallis apr
