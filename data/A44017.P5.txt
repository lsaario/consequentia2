right honourable others learned member royal society advancement science presenteth consideration humble servant thomas hobbes confutation theoreme hath long time passed truth great hinderance geometry also natural philosophy thereon dependeth theoreme four side square divided number equal part example 10 straight line drawn opposite point divide square 100 lesser square received opinion dr wallis commonly useth root 100 namely 10 side whole square confutation root 10 number square whereof whole containeth 100 whereof one square vnitie therefore root 10 10 square therefore root 100 square 10 square side square side square superficies line root 100 vnities 10 vnities 100 souldiers 10 souldiers root 100 square 10 square therefore theoreme false false root augmented multiplying greater number hence followeth proposition either demonstrated confuted false theoreme upon upon numeration infinite grounded geometry dr wallis hath hitherto published said servant humbly prayeth judgement hereupon finde false would pleased correct suffer necessary science geometry stifled save credit professor three paper presented royal society dr wallis together consideration dr wallis answer tho hobbes malmsbury london printed author green dragon without templebar 1671 right honourable others learned member royal society advancement science humble servant thomas hobbes presenteth quantity line calculated extraction root truely found presenteth invention straight line equal arc circle square root number multiplied self produceth number number produced called square number definition example 10 multiplied 10 make 100 root 10 square number 100 consequent natural row number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 c every one square number row square number beginning 1 intermit first two number four six c none intermitted number square number square root prop square root speaking quantity line euclide defines without latitude rectangle suppose b c square ab bc cd da side every side divided 10 equal part line drawn opposite point division made 100 lesser square taken together equal square abcd therefore whole square 100 whereof one square unit therefore 10 unit root ten lesser square consequently latitude therefore cannot side square according euclide line without latitude consequent follows hence whosoever taketh principle side square meer line without latitude root square line dr wallis continually demonstrates nothing line divided number equal part soever line bredth allowed line must drawn length bredth number unite side root one length prop ii number given produced greatest root multiplied self remaining fraction let number given two hundred square greatest root 14 414 square say 200 equal product 14 self together 14 multiplied 414 14

geometrically like part consisteth eucl 24 numeral great square 196 two rectangle greatest side 14 remainder side one one rectangle greatest side double remainder side square le segment together make 200 moreover 149 200 square operation self appeareth thus side greater segment 14¼ 14¼ multiplied self make 200 product 14 greatest segment two fraction 414 414 twice 214 5614 4 4 added 196 make 200 lastly product 214 2142 17 17 149 square calculated root le 149 one two hundred square true geometrical calculation demonstrated consequent hence manifest whosoever calculates length arc line extraction root must necessarily make shorter truth unless square true root radius circle mean proportional arc quadrant two fifth describe square abcd quadrant dca side dc take dt two fifth dc dc dt

equal tv two fifth ca said servant humbly prayeth consider demonstration true evident whether way objecting square root used dr wallis whether geometry built upon upon supposition infinite number false consideration upon answer dr wallis three paper mr hobbes dr wallis sayes affirmed svppose follow seemeth supposition impossible follows either false least undemonstrated first proposition founded upon arithmetica infinitorum affirm absolute infiniteness must also understood affirm 39th proposition saith thus seeing number term increasing excess subquadruple perpetually diminished last becomes le proportion assigned proceed infinitum must utterly vanish therefore propounded infinite row quantity triplicate proportion quantity arithmetically proportional according row cubical number beginning point 0 row shall row many equal greatest 1 4 therefore manifest affirms infinite row quantity last given know well enough shift secondly sayes usually euclide infinite meant assignable finite greatest possible content interpreted thence must demonstrate conclusion hath yet done shall done conclusion also demonstration mine cap 14 art 2 3 c book de corpore steal condemnd fine quality thirdly sayes euclides 10th proposition tell book line may bisected half may bisected onwards infinitely upon supposed section infinitely continued part must supposed infinitely many deny euclide sayes line may divisible part perpetually divisible mean division part arising division perpetually finite number fourthly sayes may supposed row quantity infinitely many continually increasing whereof last given ti true man may say supposing white black supposing thinking cannot suppose infinite row quantity whereof last given say demonstrate nothing fifthly sayes one absurdity begets another superficies solid may supposed constituted infinitely long finitely great breadth continually decreasing greater proportion length increaseth center gravity toricellios solidum hyperbolicum acutum others innumerable discovered dr wallis monsieur fermat others determine requires geometry logick whatsoever latine tongue mr hobbes master remember toricellio doubt dr wallis wrong monsieur fermat understand sense ti required man geometrician logician mad next place put question absurd answer mine let ask saith still opinion argument natural philosophy prove world beginning first whether case beginning must passed infinite number year mr hobbes born secondly whether time passed infinite number thirdly whether infinite infinite number year greater number dayes hour hitherto last given fourthly whether absurdity contrary mr hobbes would perswade u argument nature prove world beginning answer willingly service truth argument might well prove god beginning thus case must passed infinite length time mr hobbes born hath passed day infinite length eighty four year day last given absurdity argument nature prove god beginning thus ti men intangle dispute cannot comprehend perhaps look solution argument prove somewhat greater infinite shall far shew concluding day backwards eternity infinite mr hobbes birth backwards eternity infinite take away day backwards time adam day mr hobbes birth remains backwards must le infinite arguing infinite ambition schoolboyes latter part first paper doubt give proportion radius arc arc upon arc proportion nothing demonstration know wrong royal society presuming cannot find impertinence proof arc tv arc r streight line cd equal arc tv arc r arc ca cannot proportional manifest supposing dc le said dc equal r another streight line le r equal arc tv body may examine asked think logician proceeded upon 25 rather part radius reason long ago arabian determined streight line whose square equal 10 square half radius equal quarter perimiter demonstration lost equality follows third proportional quadrant radius must mean proportional radius 25 answer logician though took part radius proceed lighted truth chance truth self would appear absurdity arising denial aristotle meant distinguisheth direct demonstration demonstration leading absurdity hence appears dr wallis objection rosetum invalid built upon root second paper first sayes concern men true meant whole herd apply algebra geometry secondly sayes bare number cannot side square figure would know mean bare number ten line may side square figure number bare conceive consider thing numbred ten nothing understands bare 10 struggle vain conscience puzzle thirdly sayes ten square root 100 squaresquares answer first figure squaresquare secondly follows hence root superficies 10 square lastly sayes neither number 10 10 souldiers root 100 souldiers 100 souldiers product 10 souldiers 10 souldiers last grant nothing number multiplied one another souldier cannot multiplied souldier squarefigure squarefigure though squarenumber may captain place hundred men square form must take root 100 make rank file 10 men third paper object nothing side square superficies
