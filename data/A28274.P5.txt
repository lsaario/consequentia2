mr blackalls reason replying book lately published entituled amyntor letter friend second edition london printed walter kettilby bishopshead st paul churchyard sir much urging think writing somewhat way answer amyntor seems yet read book dipt saw name frequently mentioned think must need something book bear hard upon concerned honor make reply desire therefore first read book carefully yet done consider reason shall give thought present writing answer make doubt mind viz altogether needle give either self world trouble matter amyntor first general apology writing life whether good bad men part book p see plainly concerned next part p indeed occasioned passage sermon house common therefore others may think perhaps lie reply read believe another mind easily perceive author last well enough agreed point wherein seemed differ matter fact said life milton many supposititious piece name christ apostle great person published approved suppose mean primitive time observation little reading knew much truth made exception said moreover doubted spuriousness several book yet undiscovered thro remoteness time c passage found fault proceeding mouth person high esteem heard men great part learning might give occasion others well read antiquity took think book received whole christian church part canonical scripture uncertain authority said knew piece name christ apostle spuriousness whereof discovered charged infidelity indeed doubt authority book immodesty openly affronting holy religion professed established among u declaring doubt print sayes mistaken censure book meant viz last passage excepted well former else writes p p nothing purpose either book spuriousness discovered many hundred year ago extant large catalogue whereof given u p p seems foolish mistake think word yet sayes spuriousness book yet undiscovered refer present year whenas indeed meant refer time many year since past gone else meant book ascribed certain apostolick men particularly epistle barnahas pastor hermas epistle polycarpus philippian first epistle clemens romanus corinthian seven epistle iginatus cant imagine would reply whether mean book passage excepted none certainly tell therefore sayes mean book new testament contradict could say mind reply part book would give world reason made think meant likewise book new testament spoken supposititious piece name christ apostle well great person reasonable think immediately period speaks several book spuriousness yet discovered meant several least sort mentioned name christ name apostle well name great person know meant book looking back seeing book spoken finding spoken book name great person likewise name christ apostle could understand book book name christ apostle well name great person mean would thought meant ought think distinguishd made passage excepted intire sentence self said plainly tho thought book spurious others believed genuine piece sacribed great men received piece christ apostle written mind thus clearly excepted passage former say disposed deal ingenuously might seen without help father supposes know nothing mean book new testament mentioned supposititious piece name christ since none ascribed whole bible read ever wrote thing except finger ground acquitted woman taken adultery wonder urged man lately written life john milton argument might prove paradice lost late piece ascribed author well others john milton none ti certain written could write blind answer suppose would may however truly properly enough said piece milton dictated although written see reason saviour sermon mount several sermon discourse utterd spoken tho recorded evangelist may ascribed said author phrase piece name christ reason think mentioned piece name christ apostle great men mean book new testament think since piece extant sense called piece name christ apostle spuriousness whereof hath discovered except make new testament much better reason believe mean opinion confirmed never either january since met much one single person understand passage book sense whether therefore mistake misrepresent meaning question none best knew meaning decide whether mistook indeed mistake without sufficient ground expression another question could willingly leave decided indifferent person nay chuse judge could well assured would speak mind freely men great admirer perswaded would one voice say understood look upon exposition given passage little better retractation bold position thought advanced sake like impious insinuation book said written author fear chiefly admire whether misunderstand whether good reason understand private question concerned think foolish trouble rest world sufficient last agreed main question general concern unless misunderstand much say agrees book new testament genuine ever meant contend therefore declaredp first member passage milton life spurious book published primitive time name christ apostle great men meant book mentioned catalogue p c point never disagree second member passage found fault several p book meant supposed writing certain apostolical men call barnabas hermas c learned world much divided probably greater reason shall appear either wholly reject altogether spurious wholly receive part genuine yet produced either one side moreover expresly grantedp even seven piece call viz epistle hebrew epistle james second peter second third john jude revelation doubted ancient without convincing reason received modern quarrel upon account passage thus far fully agreed may always continue good mind seems might heard friend would advise next edition milton life either alter expression passage excepted meaning may liable misunderstood else add explanation make margin great difference thus amicably composed dont see reason one else maintain dispute upon account whereas charged confidence asserting king charles first book calld icon basilike spurious without either producing new evidence proof assertion offering one word answer rational exception made testimony insists upon prove forgery making exception later evidence produced prove authentick matter fact deny whether charge justly grounded matter fact world judge last book indeed say make amends former omission suppose think done whether shall likewise leave world judge think proper take controversie another man hand better prepared better able manage self perhaps worthy person said others mr wagstaff may think formal reply needful little little indeed said amyntor said prove book supposititious hint one thing upon perusal said side believe find true viz dr gauden evidence yet appeared person friend though think friend reputation memory prove author book dr walker say dr gauden except saw book dr gaudens handwriting might yet dr gauden transcriber author according said mr le plas letter mr gauden say whether fragment published larger narrative printed amyntor husband dr gauden still nay even lord anglesie testifies hand told royal brother supposing memorandum lord handwriting contains true relation told person though five hundred shall testifie hearsay royal brother dr gauden still plainly appearing whole story particularly mr north paper king charles second brother believe thought believe book father till dr gauden order get good bishoprick good service told otherwise dr gaudens testimony therefore single evidence side leave consider whether manifest interest affirming zeal pursuing interest report evident render single testimony liable great suspicion leave world consider weight validity man testimony especially testifies advantage case matter testimony cant credited without allowing witness formerly guilty notorious forgery consequently credible witness conclusion amyntor author take occasion offence sermon given represent great inconveniencies happened observation january sermon preached upon day may expect perhaps say something dont think either needful convenient judge matter proper debated parliament private person one thing noted conclusion perhaps may think lie upon one else defend viz speaking k charles sermon say best king best men expression say several angry especially except present king might added twas greater fault would another write self chaplain majesty author think say offended expression suppose several indeed upon account angry conversant ancient author yet far read even testament beginning st luke gospel v stile theophilus excellent suppose even beginner read think st luke meant make comparison excellent person much le prefer theophilus men holy apostle lord excepted therefore manifestly invidious cavil think need answer especially sermon self tho commended k charles virtue allow fault fault since charged upon might believe led misinformation mistake extent power prerogative said consistent integrity mind fault think hardly called vice immorality sir hope satisfied reason man engage self controversie j author milton life reflection several place amyntor almost
