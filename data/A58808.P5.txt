solicitous care avoiding every thing may displease distaste greatest ambition love appear lovely amiable eye beloved may doth studiously avoid whatsoever may displeasing distastful industriously endeavour adorn self obliging grace apt endear recommend love god cannot desire lovely eye desire sincere hearty must necessarily engage u endeavour acquiring whatsoever amiable pleasing avoiding whatsoever hateful grievous vertue true goodness beauty endear u god render u lovely eye sin wickedness deformity hate abhors u love hatred regulated like unaccountable impulse mutable fancy steady eternal rule never love hated hate loved immutability god love hatred consists always love hate person always love hate person reason motive indeed love foolish fondness hatred unreasonable antipathy without reasonable motive always determines person god love hate person upon reasonable motif love hatred would fickle mutable motif cease love hatred continue continue love u reason wholly ceased first moved thereunto must either love u reason would foolish fondness must love u contrary reason would fickleness inconstancy therefore god cease love hate person reason loving hating cease proceeds inconstancy immutability love hatred though may change object yet never change reason reason god love hatred object love hate therefore change object love hatred changed love person hated person

founded likeness suppose reason god love hatred u likeness vnlikeness resemble goodness truth purity justice essential nature must need love u sake partake nature allied similitude temper perfection unlike contrary impure spightful malicious false unrighteous unreasonable hath antipathy u founded nature love u whilst contrarily disposed hate wherefore since nothing render u lovely god eye resembling purity goodness nothing render u hateful offensive distastful impure wicked unlike hence necessarily follows otherwise render self amiable otherwise avoid offending grieving keeping commandment therein grace enjoined wherein resemblance consists vice forbid contrary deform u eye imitate nature shall acquire godlike temper mind render u glorious lovely esteem decked star cloathed

make weak thing strong turn coward hero warms animates heart generous fire disdain opposition courageously outbraves greatest danger difficulty love heartily would thing sake beloved measuring strength greatness desire think able whatsoever strongly doth passion transport nature beyond bound ability inspiring force vigour scarce thing able withstand therefore love god sincerely heartily love must necessarily resolve obedience never hard difficult love enliven animate endeavour serving carry u spirit alacrity weary stage duty meat drink instance obedience never hard difficult love smother render easy delightful love self pleasure mine will end interest involved one another love measure intense cordial shall pleasure perform complacency delight whatsoever difficulty meet serving

since necessary property love god make u ready undergo thing sake also must necessarily resolve keeping commandment willing thing god shall surely willing obey though obedience instance may difficult yet love real conquer way thus see essential property love god finally resolve obedience whence evident wheresoever love god certainly prove principle obedience ii proceed second head discourse shew

weight fear wheel religion stand still immediately plainly see bare fear never lasting steady principle religion troublesome men long patience endure love naturally sweet grateful passion sooth ravishes heart put spirit brisk generous motion long continues pure love always attended joy pleasure self much terminated upon god disquietude love arise imperfection object either person beloved coy cruel imbitters love sorrow regret else fickle inconstant inflames rage jealousy love fix upon god hath neither cause disturbance infinitely loving unto love never change object love unless change prove fickle unconstant affection whilst hath reason love love always constant immutable love god reason grief jealousy commonly intermingled carnal love affection fixed upon object doth well deserve amply requite find nothing infinite cause pleasure complacency object love infinitely lovely infinitely loving affection must need unspeakably pleasing grateful love god see must need sweet serene productive delightful ravishing emotion nothing tends greatest content satisfaction must necessarily prove lasting principle obedience wheresoever always attended substantial pleasure delight temptation extinguish long feel nothing highly grateful nature shall far using art quit self shall think greatest interest promote increase still love better shall pleased better pleased shall endeavour love pleasure love mutually provoke augment one another till arrived utmost height perfection thus love god see lasting principle ti fire live upon fuel self creates maintain self ever strength vigour feeding upon joy pleasure produce principle upon obey religion must need lasting steady acted animated principle thus demonstrated proposition text wheresoever love god express self obedience shall conclude whole practical inference 1 hence infer necessary religion keep good thought god world without men never able love without love never reduced submission heavenly love alone god reign heart doth acquire preserve empire soul may awed forced fawning submission meerly dread terror power obliged serve indian devil fear u mischief tear u piece meerly religion slave forced undergo one evil fear another hate fear suffering cannot endure slave generally hate fear even whilst fawning cringing imperious master much rather cut throat could safety men acted obedience god meerly slavish dread vengeance generally hate whilst obey power would rather ungod pull throne render homage dare withhold possible know heart men see inmost working mind ever pleased base sordid religion religion conjoyned inveterate hatred person government restrains men fear punishment flying face religion wholly founded passion cause u hate well fawn upon carry secret antipathy nature law would much rather vent self open rebellion forced submission power enough defend self fury yet best religion mankind capable without love god ever intend keep generous religion soul becomes freeborn mind offer great sovereign world must sure purge sower rigid notion god represent way unlovely u 2ly hence infer miserably men mistaken make thing sign love god tends keeping commandment many person apt measure affection god christ meer impression sensitive passion upon moving affecting representation amiable object feel sensitive emotion wont fall love thing feel spirit soothing ravishing heart heart diffusing opening let soft amorous spirit conclude presently infinitely love god saviour whereas many time meerly effect amorous complection tinctured inflamed religious idea commonly remote virtue love light darkness heaven hell many men sincerely good yet cannot raise sensitive passion religious exercise heartily sorry sin yet cannot weep entirely love god delight service yet cannot

heart dilate rapture sensitive love spirit tickle extasies joy purely resolved different temper men body temper naturally calm sedate scarce capable disturbed passion others soft tender impressible frivolous fancy able raise commotion hence see people weep heartily misfortune lover play romance heartily rejoyce good success though know fiction mere idea fancy whereas others scarce shed tear raise sensitive joy real calamity prosperity friend yet love great deal better others supposed feigned romantick hero yet sensitive transport men sometimes feel fancy chafed pathetical description god presently vote friend lover whereas truth commonly move affection thing real either god christ sensual beauty attributed fanciful description smites carnalized fancy generally find metaphorical god christ men fall love set idol god christ fancy dress carnal metaphor allusion sensual mind apt taken imagin smile kiss caress pretty endearment doating lover whereupon grow extreamly fond able forbear hugging dandling ala poor men hug cloud instead godess think god christ arm embrace nothing specter fancy let person though hero romance lover play described language glistering allusion shall experience passion god saviour thus roman nunnery monastery generally find monk fall love virgin mary whilst nun enamoured jesus christ chuse object love according different inclination sex reason chuse differently frame different carnal idea different object love suitable agreeable carnal inclination commonly neither monk love virgin mary nun jesus christ meerly doat upon different image fancy represent divine beauty sacred person well deserve beloved thus commonly among self yet pretend zealous lover god wherefore unless mind deceive self let u longer depend fallacious evidence let u try love god touchstone obedience heavenly man love saith saviour keep word jo xiv23 ye friend ye whatsoever command saith st john love ye walk commandment eph ii6 love god christ rational love valued rational effect produce u transform u image god make u love love hate hate much certain indication love ravishing effect sensitive passion though heart melted transport fondness yet long heart practice incomplyant law look upon u deal u hypocrite enemy esteem sensitive fondness towards base flattery juda kissed betrayed 3ly hence infer great reason god doth strictly enjoyn u love command whatsoever often repeated scripture loving god thou shalt love lord thy god thy heart thy soul doth lord thy god require thee love love lord ye saint take heed therefore self ye love lord god world reiterated injunction love meet sacred page come pas doth god need love importunately call doth contribute thing happiness see beloved great world being hath made hath endued capacity loving though

well neither reason ti true thing infinitely reasonable self lovely beloved affection united fountain being wellbeing god author reasonable faculty cannot desire act reasonably love best best deserves beloved particular end god doth earnestly crave exact love yes doubtless every way worthy hath proposed cannot supposed infinitely wise ever act without end aim god infinitely happy cannot supposed

importunately demand love add thing good u goodness extendeth god psalmist tell u xvi2 though love god great perfection nature yet job tell u gain god make way perfect job xxii3 though none god yet infinite gain self end reason requires already shewd principle obedience god love pregnant fruitful god requires u obey good enjoyned u nothing tends perfection happiness nature requires u love may intirely perfectly obey thereby speedily arrive happiness infinite goodness hath designed u profit love obedience accrues self ti reap fruit virtue exalted homage render maker happy without love united flame angel saint meet concenter add one spark infinite element happiness infinite could admit increase lover glorified love god requires exacts love great soul obedience obedience necessary mean happiness profit must necessarily redound self ti must inriched glorified reason therefore god requires love may living principle obedience might accelerate happiness whose love god arrived

scripture plainly tell u glory end end doth well obtain hurt good others damning well saving others answer glory god mean thing else free communication goodness others false say glory end glory said

good whatsoever love self must necessarily love resemblance likeness lovely u lovely another reason love self reason love another resembles u thing love self ti true poor imperfect creature many time
