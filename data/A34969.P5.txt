sit romana ecclesia irrepraehensibilis videlicet nihil est creditu necessarium religione christiana tanquam de fide nisi quod revelatum fuit ecclesiae per christum apostolos ejus respondetur quod haec thesis ut jacet est omnino irrepraehensibilis immo nihil est proprie de side cujus actus necessario mediate innititur divinae revelationi nisi quod revelatum fuerit deo ecclesiae per christum apostolos ab eorum enim tempore nihil de novo ecclesiae revelatum agnoscimus qu utrum omnes articuli de religione concilio tridentino determinati propositus sin veritates divinae tale quae ab apostolis fuerint ecclesiae revelatae resp omnes articuli pure doctrinales nec aliam inclu entes materiam facti quam quod divinitus institutum agnov mu determinati concilio tridentino tale sunt quoad

semper habebatur multis ecclesiae doctoribus divini fuisse alicujus authoris cui scilicet istius libri doctrina ad religionem spectans aut immediate spiritu sancto revelata fuerit aut illa tradenda divinum adfuerit speciale auxilium de prima parte potest concilium vere oecumenicum certissime decernere de secunda cum majori vel minori cer itundine juxta varias um circumstantias ita tamen ut canonicam semper habebit certitudinem hujusmodi concilii etiam hac parte decretum quod idem dicendum est de vulgatae editionis decreto licet pure materiam facti designet de communione sub una tantum specie concil decretum est negativum videlicet ecclesiam non teneri nec institution seu prae epto divino nec quacunque alia de causa sacramentum e charistiae fidelibus omnibus sub utraque specie administra et hoc certistimum habet ecclesia ex traditione praxi vero justis de causis unam tantum speciem communiter administrari decreverit prudentiae non doctrinae quaestio est de veneratione imaginum quamvis re facti sit hoc tamen ab ipsis apostolorum temporibus traditum habemus qu non haec sit pobabilis ratio distinguendi inter tale articulos scilicet ponendi istos articulos esse revelationes divinas quibus concilium explicite significat ecclesiam traditionaliter recipisse talem doctrinam primis usque christianismi temporibus resp hanc rationem seu viam distenguendi inter tale articulos probabilem ac sanam esse non vero solam unicam oportet enim ut articuli qui sint revelationis divinae sint doctrinales qui nunquam ab omnibus ecclesiae doctoribus habebantur incerti tunc etiamsi concilium declararet hujusmodi articulos ad novatoris alicujus obtundendam audaciam absque eo quod agnoscat expresse illos traditionaliter receptos esse attamen hoc necessario subintelligiretur novum enim aliquod nequit concilium oecumenicum ecclesiae proponere ut revelatum nec si proponeret ab ecclesia recip retur qu utrum omnes articuli legitimo concilio propositus sint recipiendi amplectendi vel christiana fide scilicet qnod ad articulos divinitus revelatos vel sal em obedientia canonica quod ad reliquos quae bedientia scilicet obligat omnes ad non contradicendum

conciliariter agat qu utrum assistentia spiritus sancti ecclesiae promissa necessario credendum sit simpliciter omnem veritatem eam ducturum au solum necessariam resp necessum est credere spiritum sanctum non dico inducturum sed conservaturum ecclesiam catholicam om doctrina seu veritate revelata immo ita recturum eam ut nunquam errorem aliquam notabilem id est qui vergat gravissimum animarum detrimentum universaliter induci permitrat licet errorem facti forsitan non immediate expresse revelatae incidere poterit par major ecclesiae qu utrum concilium secundum quod stapletonus affirmat possit erronee proponere doctrinas quasdam scilicet quae adfundamenium religionis non appropinquant non veras resp primo notandum esse quod aliud est concilium oecumenicum ecclesiae doctrinas

tribunali quicquid sit non denegamus concilium oecumenicum posse quibusda circumstantiis ecclesiae proponere doctrinas quae nec immediate continentur revelatis nec sunt de rebus magni momenti sed vel facti vel disciplinae quodammodo falsas aut non omnino veras qu utrum unquam definitum fuerit ab aliquo concilio oecumenico ecclesiam vel concilium esse infallibilem et si sic ubi resp nunquam quod meminerim evidentissimis sepo itis scripturae locis expresse definitum legi supponitur enim ad omnem definitionem infallibilis haec decernendi potestas quippe si cuilibet licuerit supremi tribunalis sive ecclesiastici sive saecularis authoritatem ac jurisdictionem dubium revocare ruunt certe omnis regiminis gubernationis fundamenta si vero talus decernentis authoritati credendum ac cedeudum

infallibilis importer divinam quandam assistentiam inerrabilitatem solum moralem summo gradu certitudinem cui scilicet inniti possent homines sine aliquo periculo immo omnin ebeant resp quod hujus questionis solutio maxime pendet de propria vocabulorum significatione nimirum quaenam infallibilitas vel certitudo quam di nu divinam quaenam naturalis id est naruralis evidentiae quaenam moralis quae omnia ex logicae principiis desumenda dissolvenda sunt quod non est hujas locus praesentiarum sufficit quod talis sit ecclesiae infallibilitas seu inerrabilitas quaeque ex divino proveniat instituto auxilio ut errorem christianae doctrinae ac religioni oppositum nunquam induce ur nec portae inferi praevalebunt adversus eam ut tibi vero qui difficultatum medulla sol penetrare plenius faciam satis tanti momenti ex qua nimirum caeterarum omnium inter christianos controversiarum petenda est solutio superaddam hic breviter quod nondum nec verbis nec scriptis accepisti ecclesiam esse infallibilem tum ex promissis christi domini sacrum scriptura frequenter habitis tum ex natura ipsius traditionis universalis ecclesiae quam etiam genere sumptam infallibilem esse alibi satis si recte memineris tibi evidentissime demonstravimus ecclesiam autem esse infallibilem nihil aliud est quam ecclesiam non posse falli id est universalem ecclesiam unitam sub una ejusdem fidei sacramentorum communione non posse errare traditione christianae ac revelatae doctrinae quae scilicet christo ab apostolis ejus per universum orbem edocta ac disseminata fuerit doctrina haec christiana cujus traditione nequit ecclesia veritate aberrare non solum continet dogma quae veluri mere speculativa videntur trinitatem nempe incarnationem c quae licet ad christianae vitae perfectionem parum aut nihil conducere existiment novatores attamen vera totius christianae praxeos base sunt fundamenta sed etiam christianorum operum christianae vitae institutiones actus ut sacramentorum administratione

ecclesia definitor quorum nulla habetur revelationis divinae universalis traditio quae tamen talis est conditionis naturae ut omnes ecclesiae subditi membra hisce teneantur subcribere obedire definitionibus prima infallibilitas sola ecclesia universali residet neque papa neque concilio nisi quantum ecclesiae unversali consentire cohaerere creduntur alterutro tamen ecclesia universali
