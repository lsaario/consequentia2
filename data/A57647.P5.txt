medicorum placitis qui ex mari feminae seminibus conceptu fieri statuunt que etiam aristotel dissidens qui mari semen formam ut agens conferre foeminam materiam asserit ovam generationis sciographiam depingit qua nec semen utquod uterum nequaquam ingreditur nec foeminae quippe quae semine caret locu ullum habere contendit sed sceminam foecundam fieri post tactum coitu sperma ticum simili virtute qua fercum magnete tactum hoc notat contagium prolificum nec hic subtilis vir requiescit verum postea altiore gradu pedem figere videtur et foeminam ex conceptu idaeae generalis sine materia impregnatam esse similitudine constitutionis cerebri uterus utrius que functionem similem esse vult ut quemadmodum cerebro artificis est ratio sui operis specie immaterialis ita utero insit specie five forma filius immaterialis quae sit causa impregnationis haec summa que ultima meta est quam exercitationum suarum cursu contendere nititur plura tamen sunt per totam operis seriem disseminata quae summus ille philosophiae augur rationibus ex ipsius naturae penetralibus petitis quasi quirinali lituo designat dum haec perlegi veterum doctrinae ita contraria luctabantur tonsae lento difficili

hesterna nocte vir eruditissime sed solo literarum candoris nomine mihi cognita epistolam tuam latiomelle conditam accepi qua sententiam meam requiris quodnam judicium habendum sit de clarissimi doctoris harvaei opinione generatione animalium ego sane non sum nescius meae imbecilitat quam que impar sit congressus achilli nihilominus veritatis praesideo fretus animam assumpsi ut cum homero loquar nonlatin alphabet conatus sum hesitantes per flumen traducere nam suasu amicorum aggressus sum doctoris literatissimi opinionem eam que ni fallor conferti pro mei viribus tractatu illo anglico quem nuperrime typis commisi scio plurimos esse longe doctrinae laude praestantiores inter quos tu mihi videris non minimus qui debebant hanc provinciam suscepere sed cum adverterem omnes monomacheam hanc detractantes volebam potius periculo exponere quam alto silentio permittere ut opinio talis apud nostrates qui quicquid novum est avide sine masticatione deglutiant hospitium haberet fortasse stomachabitur doctor quod ego micantibus eruditionis suae radiis nebulam hac mea scriptione objicerem famae suae splendorem mea refutatione obfuscarem sed pro ingemita viris doctis humanitate non ignorat civitate libera debere lingua pennas esse liberas oppugnandos errores quoc um que authore processerint amicitia enim veritatis platonicae socraticae praeferenda est ego intra modestiae limites continui neque quidquam mea penna lapsum est quod posset illius famae officere neque ab omni errore liber esse potest quamdiu homo est si autem pergat hanc suam helenam ulterius propugnare igbo animis contra vel magnum praestet achillem interea autem vir doctissime quisquis e haud equidem invitis coelestibus aura vitales carpis tibi meam sententiam breviter aperiam quum tam humaniter compellas haec opinio videtur religione rectum ratione prorsus aliena nam si mari semen uterum non ingrediatur sed foemina tactu virtuali solum concipiat isaac proinde christus non magi dicendi sunt semen abrahae quam solis nam sol contactu virtuali generat hominem ne que potest ullus filius di aut esse o de ossibus aut caro de carne parentu quando mater semine careat patris autem semen uterum non ingrediatur haecopinio tollit omnem amorem paternum erga liberos omnem que provid ntiam quis enim pater sollicitus erit haereditatemilli relinquere quem scit non esse filium quomodo autem filius dicendus est qui ex substantia patris non est loquor hic de filio naturali non adoptivo quorsum creavit deus marem foeminam quorsum utrum que arca conservavit si absque mari semine concipere valet foemina vir non potest vocari adulter nec ulli possunt generari adulterio quum semen viri uterum non recipiatur cum que quotidianum sit ut foemina absque corporali tactu virilis seminis concipiat quid miraculi fuit christum sic concipi quorsum honorandus est pater ex quinto praecepto si pater non sit quomodo autem pater est qui non generat quomodo generat si semen uterum non emittat simile autem quo utitur doctor sumptum magnete im pertinens est nam dicit tactum spermaticum coitu esse virtualem cum ferrum tangitur magnete ibi tactus est corporalis magnes etiam trahit corpus ferri sic debet uterus semen si similitudo valet deinde scire cupio utrum semen masculeum recipiatur intra matricem non sinon quo abit cur etiam aperitur matrix ad recipiendam virtutem solum seminis sine corpore nugae virtu non est corpus non ergo opus est apertione nulla nam que penetratio dimensionum erit si ostium occludatur si autem recipiatur semen ab utero tangat sanguiuem menstruum tactus ille corporalis crit non virtualis praeterea tactu virtuali tangens aut est spiritus sic animae virtualiter tangit corpus intelligentia coelum aut toto genere differt tacta tale est coelum quod tangit inferiora corpus virtualiter semen nec est spiritus sed corpus nec genere differt sanguine quia ex sanguine fit ergo non tangit virtualiter dice magnes tangit ferrum virtualiter sed hoc nego nullus enim est tactus illic nisi corporalis fertur quidem acus ad magnetem ingenita quadam vi sicut lapis ad centrum ideo concludemus centrum tangere virtualiter lapidem nihil minus sed si concederem esse virtualem contactum magnete rogo cui sini data est illa virtu nonne ut fiat contactus corporalis videmus enim haec corporaliter se tangere ne contenta esse virtuali tactu eodem modo semini data est virtu tangendi sanguinem utero ut realiter corporaliter se tangant cum datur opportunitas debuit etiam dr nobis ostendere quantum mora requiratur quantum distantia ad virtualem hanc actionem videmus enim serium magnetem non se tangere nisi debita distantia idque ab que ulla mora quomodo etiam fit ut filius referat patrem vultu moribus si paternum semen agat solum virtualiter si etiam seminis actio sit solum virtualis quid opus erat calore humore aliisque qualitatibus elementaribus virtualis quippe contactus fit ab occulta non ab elementari manifesta qualitate deinde nulla fit conceptio nisi semen detinea ur utero illa detentio est presentia corporalis non virtualis nec ulla generatio dicenda est univoca si semen agat solum virtualiter eodem enim modo generabitur homo quo mu virtute solis ex putrifactione sed inepte vocat spermaticum tactum contagium est enim contagium morbus contractus ex contactu co tus non est morbus quum nihil magi sit secundum maturam cum autem dicit doctor feminam ex concepiu daeae generalis sine materia impregnatam esse videtur ne ire naturam daeae quae nil aliud est quam exemplar futuri opificii mente opificis exemplar autem nec est efficiens nec materialis causa rerum nam statuae efficiens est statuarius materia lapis aut lignum aut metallum forma est representatio illius idaeae quam artifex mente habuit secundum ergo exemplar illud artifex introducit formam statuae materiam ope variorum instrumentorum non ergo fit filius materialis ex immateriali sed ex parentum semine sauguine ad exemplar illud seu filium immaterialem non utero sed cerebro quod est propria sedes phantasmatum idearum ob organon apta spiritus animales neque enim ulla est similitudo ut putat doctor inter cerebrum uterum sive substantiam sive qualitates sive constitutionem sive operationes consideremus nam cerebro producuntur idaeae phantasmata utero corporales substantiae hoc est filius materialis illo immaterialis sed haec satis refutavimus tractatu nostro anglico quar hic nolo tecum pluribus agere haec sufficiant ut scias nec vetis tuis deesse nec humanitatis leges silentio meo violare voluisse quare confestim vale vir liter atissime amicis sine fuco tui omniumque qui
