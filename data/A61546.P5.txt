church society would arise meerly legislative power commonwealth divine law binding conscience whose obligation cannot bee superseded humane law plain evident vastly different obligation different power sense know incongruity admitting imperium imperio wee understand external coactive power internal power laying obligation conscience distinct power lodged commonwealth considered outward coactive power alwayes disowned christ certainly internall power conscience oblige disciple duty hee thought fit secondly argue officer whose right govern society founded charter whereby society self

consent party next grand inquiry concerning extent power whether doth reach far excommunication men seem wholly deny power church offendors church doth subsist divine institution yet wholly deny power excommunication seem rather say church officer may far congruously office inflict mulct upon offendors exclude participation communion others ordinance sacrament gospel order therefore clearing come third proposition power christ hath given officer church doth extend exclusion contumacious offendors priviledges society enjoyes term rather choose fix crude expression wherein erastus follower would state question imprudent adversary accepted viz whether churchofficers power exclude eucharist ob moralem impuritatem reason wave term must confess self yet unsatisfied convincing argument whereby proved denyed admission lord supper admitted part churchsociety owned member cannot yet see particular reason drawn nature lord supper part divine worship confine censure church meerly ordinance make eucharist bear office body church new anatomist tell u parenchyme liver doth natural body viz colum sanguinis serve kind strainer separate gross faeculent part blood pure spirituous lord supper strain impure member church holy spiritual judgement excommunication relates immediately cutting person communion church visible society constituted upon end communion visibly discerned administration participation gospel ordinance therefore exclusion doth chiefly refer lord supper one highest priviledges church enjoyes therefore stand reason censure begin sense suspension lord supper person apparently unworthy may embraced prudent lawful convenient abatement greater penalty excommunication stand general ground doth qui potest majus potest etiam minus hold well moral natural power prohibition contrary peculiar reason one dislike term ob moralem impuritatem account suppose taken erastus others controversie managed concerning excommunication among jew viz whether meerly ceremonial else likewise moral impurity must ingenuously acknowledge erastus hath much advantage adversary clearly proving person law excluded templeworship moral impurity withall think hath gained little advantage cause great successful pain hath taken proving reason templeworship sacrifice law sense propitiatory adumbration grand sacrifice offered appeasing god wrath viz blood christ therefore excluded participation exclude visible way obtaining pardon sin without shedding blood apostle tell u testifying faith towards god heb repentance dead work gospel ordinance suppose admission church baptism thereby suppose alsufficient sacrifice offered expiation sin consequently subsequent priviledges immediately relate obtaining grateful comemmoration death christ celebration infinite mercy goodness god way redemption found death son therefore stand great reason person profane unworthy life dishonour holy profession owned good sound member society founded sacred foundation christian religious person know nothing objected first passeover commemorative among jew secondly priviledges people great people therefore god intended thing excommunication among people would use answer grant passeover commemorative occasion institution withall typical annunciative lamb god take away sin world therefore person desired expiation sin debard lord supper gospel hath nothing propitiatory intended feast upon sacrifice federal rite hath fully cleared learned person discourse true notion lord supper grant jew many priviledges nation nay far whole body people looked upon god chosen peculiar holy people thence justly infer whatever exclusion among people jew society far better hold argument excommunication christian church meer debarring levitical worship far sooner insist upon reason assigned ground excommunication infirm profligated argument exclusion camp israel cerith among jew whatever understand may pari hold ground exclusion christian society imitation rather suppose exclusion synagogue taken rather meer outlawry deprived civill power question thus clearly stated amount whether gospel s power officer church vertue divine institution exclude offender christian society transgressing law according former proposition suppose sufficient prove power divine institution prove fundamentally intrinsecally resident society self ever doth immediately result society self must original subject hath hath nature inseparable property resulting constitution clearing shall lay thought clearly methodically following hypothesis power declaring person true member society formal power excommunication intend viz authoritative pronouncing virtute officii convict offender forfeited interest church christian society lose priviledges power lodged church officer hath power formally excommunicate enjoyment priviledges society absolute necessary depends upon condition performed every member society judge power ruler society debarr person priviledges upon nonperformance condition supposing jus civitatis depend upon defending right city upon failing referente person admitted citizenship ruler city power take right away first give right never absolutely given upon supposition person overthrow end bestowed upon church society communion absolute necessary doth depend performance condition governours competent judge appears admission church depends upon condition judged pastor case adult person requiring baptism child infidel baptized case evident condition prerequisite pastor judge priviledges society require separation society world call greater holiness purity life priviledges pledge greater benefit belong person qualified suitable condition would therefore great dishonour society lay common open society world qualification required member instance sacred record apostolical time scandal ground exclusion person guilty priviledges christian society suppose may notwithstanding little evasion found fix incestuous person church corinth lay force argument upon manner execution censure viz delegation apostle apostolical rod delivering satan freely grant import extraordinary power apostle offender say ground reason exercise power extraordinary manner time doth still continue although visible extraordinary effect whatever practice founded upon ground perpetual common practice must continue long ground church capacity admit hypothesis rational foundation episcopal government church doth stand firm unshaken former discourse far undermining intelligent reader may perceive say evident reason apostle censure person fetched want christian magistrate thing hold long christian church dishonour society corinth spreading corruption pas uncensured corinth amendment person cor upon pillar power censure rest self church god main ground penalty society whatsoever viz preservation honour preventing mischief good offending party seems add great deal weight instance apostle check corinthian exercise apostolical rod sensible great dishonour church used mean removing person society ye puffed rather mourned hath done deed may taken away among corinth therein implying whether thing church apostolical rod duty christian society done endeavour order removing person number cannot understand duty christian withdraw every brother walketh disorderly cor thess churchofficers power pronounce person withdrawn amount excommunication material whether immediately relate civil sacred converse concerning much dispute soever place churchofficers power pronounce person withdrawn power excommunication consider penalty inflicted person relation society christian withall nearly conjoyned civil spiritual eating together corinth strongly argument hold civil sacred viz remotione unius ad remotionem alterius fancyed pollution sacris company wicked men dishonour reflecting society unworthy person partaking highest priviledges thus three hypothesis corollary follows person church open contumacious offence declare world far person supposed admission church power resident pastor church debar person priviledges consequently communion lord supper expresseth nearest union closest confederation nonlatin alphabet among grecian commonwealth hath alwayes looked greatest veneration church god therefore least fit person admitted highest priviledges church unworthy lowest s remain objection levelled opinion concerning power excommunication question thus stated proved soon removed first excommunication outward punishment therefore belongs churchofficers magistrate neither ever power churchofficer debar offending member publick worship heathen may come cannot lie exclusion lord supper christ offered spiritual food well word preached sacrament answer well understand objector mean outward punishment punishment belonging visible society church considered must visible e outward thing taken notice world sense deny visible punishment belongs magistrate outward meant forcible punishment grant coactive power belongs magistrate deny excommunication formally considered forcible punishment every person entrance society supposed declare submission rule society therefore whatever undergoes way penalty society doth depend upon consent person stand excommunicate legally de jure declared authoritativly member society though may present act defranchised person may corporation person falling offence merit excommunication supposed voluntarily renounce interest prviledges enjoyment doth depend upon abstaining offence wilfully fall especially contumacy joyned excommunication nothing done forcibly towards first relinquisheth right churchgovernour declares excluded society offendor doth meritoriously excommunicate pastor doth formally declaring hath made member offence contumacy joyned second answer place formality excommunication exclusion hearing word debarring person hearing tanquam par eoclesiae member church hearing may well joined heathen infidel member church third answer exclusion lord supper account mentioned objection one chiefest priviledges church visible society thus cleared asserted power excommunication christian church remains one enquiry whether power doth remain formally church incorporated commonwealth else doth escheate wholly civil power resolution question mainly depends another spoken already viz whether power kind widow estate belonged separation civil power church absolutely infeoffed perpetual right belonging condition whatsoever must appear tenure ground conveyed proved already perpetual universal thence appears accession church invalidate former title
