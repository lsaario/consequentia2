judgment great day namely end world son man shall come glory holy angel shall sit upon throne glory nation shall gathered shall separated two great company righteous wicked shall stand one right hand left great judge shall pronounce sentence severally upon according action done life righteous shall rewarded eternal happiness wicked shall sentencd everlasting punishment wicked shall go away everlasting punishment righteous life eternal word plain need explication take granted every one first hearing clearly apprehend difference righteous wicked endless happiness misery although word easie understood never much considerd u scope design represent u different fate good bad men another world end different way doings world serious consideration whereof greatest discouragement sin powerful argument world holy vertuous life argument taken greatest lasting interest happiness misery eternity concernment vast consequence must greatest stupidity folly world man neglect eternal state reward punishment another world blessed saviour hath clearly revealed u one part viz good men shall eternally happy another world every one gladly admits many loth part true concerning eternal punishment wicked men therefore pretend contrary justice god punish temporary crime eternal torment justice always observes proportion offence punishment temporary sin eternal punishment proportion seems hard reconcild justice much excess goodness suppose god therefore say though god seem declard impenitent sinner shall everlastingly punishd yet declaration scripture mollified understood may able reconcile essential perfection divine nature full force strength objection work time shall clear difficult point two reason first vindication divine justice goodness god may justified saying appear righteous judgeth secondly belief threatnings god utmost extent great moment good life great discouragement sin sting sin terrour eternal punishment men set free fear belief powerful restraint sin would taken away answer objection shall endeavour prove two thing first eternal punishment wicked men another world plainly threatned scripture secondly inconsistent either justice goodness god first eternal punishment wicked men another world plainly threatned scripture namely following text matth better thee enter life halt maimed two hand two foot cast everlasting fire matth depart ye cursed everlasting fire prepared devil angel text wicked shall go away everlasting punishment mark three several time great vehemency repeated saviour worm dyeth fire quenched thess speaking know god obey gospel son said shall punishd everlasting destruction know well great endeavour hath usd avoid force text shewing word ever everlasting frequently usd scripture limited sence long duration continuance thus ever doth often old testament signifie long time till end jewish dispensation epistle st jude verse city sodom gomorrah said set forth example suffering vengeance eternal fire fire extinguishd till city utterly consumed therefore clear meaning forementioned text first shall readily grant word ever everlasting always scripture signifie endless duration sufficiently proved instance alledgd purpose secondly cannot denyed hand word often scripture used larger sence necessarily signifie interminable endless duration eternity attributed god said live ever ever eternal happiness another world promised good men shall ever lord word expression used concerning punishment wicked men another life great reason understand extent god intended told u punishment wicked men shall end language wherein scripture written hardly afford fuller certain word used case whereby express u duration without end likewise almost peremptory decision thing duration punishment wicked men sentence expressd word usd duration happiness righteous evident text speaking wicked shall go away nonlatin alphabet eternal punishment righteous nonlatin alphabet life eternal proceed second thing proposd namely shew thatii inconsistent either justice goodness god force objection lie hath attempted answered several way none seems give clear full satisfaction first said sin infinite respect object committed god therefore deserves infinite punishment doubt upon examination found subtlety solidity ti true indeed dignity person offence committed great aggravation fault reason offence god certainly greatest crime hereby heightend infinite degree mean admitted plain reason evil demerit sin must necessarily equal demerit sin infinite demerit sin equal reason degree punishment another world deny degree punishment contrary reason saviour express assertion shall beaten many stripe fewer shall tolerable day judgment others besides reason lest sin committed god may said infinite object least punishment inflicted god may said infinite author punishment god well sin would equal palpably absurd answer mean sufficient break force objection secondly said others wicked men lived ever world would sin ever therefore deserve punishd ever hath neither truth reason enough give satisfaction certainly tell man lived never long would never repent grow better besides justice god doth onely punish sin men committed life might possibly committed lived longer thirdly said last place god hath set men everlasting happiness misery sinner hath choice two thing said seem bid fairly towards answer first reward god promiseth obedience equal punishment threatens disobedience yet doubt reach business though contrary justice exceed reward matter meer favour yet may exceed punishment secondly said sinner case hath nothing complain since hath choice confess enough silence sinner make acknowledge destruction yet seem clearly satisfie objection disproportion fault punishment therefore shall endeavour clear may matter yet little following consideration first let considerd measure penalty respect crime onely always taken quality degree offence much le duration continuance end reason government require penalty may possible secure observation law deter men breach reason evident declard man suffer longer crime according proportion time committed consequence would sinner would better husband time sin much faster might greater bargain might satisfie sin shorter punishment would unreasonable likewise upon another account greatest sin may perhaps committed shortest time instance murther act whereof may moment effect perpetual kill man kill ever act murther may committed trice injury endless irreparable objection temporary crime punishd much longer suffering plainly force besides whoever considers ineffectual threatning even eternal torment greatest part sinner soon satisfid le penalty eternal suffering would far greatest part mankind probability little force therefore thing terrible eternal vengeance could threatned worker iniquity unreasonable would little enough deter men effectually sin proportion crime penalty ought bear properly consideration justice wisdom prudence lawgiver reason seems plain measure penalty taken strict proportion betwixt crime punishment one great end design goverment secure observation wholesome necessary law consequently whatever penalty proper necessary end unjust consideration desire may especially observed strike foundation objection appointing apportioning penalty crime properly consideration justice rather prudence lawgiver whatever disproportion may temporary sin eternal suffering justice cannot said concernd justice indeed concernd righteous wicked treated alike farther yet greater sin heavier punishment mighty sinner mightily tormented may considerd adjusted degree intenseness suffering without making difference duration case short stand thus whenever break law god fall hand lye mercy may without injustice inflict punishment upon u pleaseth consequently secure law violation may beforehand threaten penalty think fit necessary deter men transgression esteemed unjust among men punish crime committed instant perpetual loss estate liberty life secondly yet appear reasonable consider threatens hath still power execution hand remarkable difference promise threatnings promiseth passeth right another thereby stand obliged justice faithfulness make good promise party promise made onely disappointed injuriously dealt withal threatnings quite otherwise threatens keep right punishing hand obliged execute hath threatned reason end government require may without injury party threatned remit abate much pleaseth punishment hath threatned worse better word body find fault complain wrong injustice thereby done impeachment god truth faithfulness esteemd among men piece falshood threatned god absolutely threaten destruction city niniveh peevish prophet understand threatning absolute angry god employing message made good god understood right pleasd notwithstanding threatning denouncd jonah touchd honour rather dyed niniveh destroyd onely verifid message know said case god hath confirmd threatnings oath certain sign immutability counsel therefore truth concernd strict rigorous execution land canaan type heaven israelite rebelld wilderness also type impenitent sinner gospel consequently oath god concerning rebellious israelite sware wrath enter rest land canaan doth equally oblige execute threatning upon impenitent sinner gospel shall never enter kingdom god truly reasond far threatning extends attend plain word beyond threatnings never stretchd doth seem reach exclusion impenitent sinner heaven falling finally short rest happiness righteous however directly overthrow opinion ascribd origen devil wicked men shall saved last god sworn wrath shall never enter rest ete nal misery punishment threatned wicked men world though necessarily comprehended oath shall enter rest yet consider tenour sentence blessed saviour hath assurd u passd upon judgment great day depart ye cursed everlasting fire likewise declaration text wicked shall go away everlasting punishment though restrain god plea yet cut sinner reasonable hope relaxation mitigation since great judge world hath made plain express declaration certainly pas sentence would greatest folly madness world sinner entertain hope escaping venture soul upon hope know one thing commonly said upon argument seems material word death destruction perishing whereby punishment wicked men world frequently expressd scripture properly import annihilation utter end therefore may reasonably understood matter speaking answer word answer language often scripture author used signifie state great misery suffering without utter extinction miserable thus god often scripture said bring destruction upon nation sends great judgment upon though exterminate make utter end nothing common language perishing express person undone made miserable known passage tiberius letter roman senate ita dij deae que omnes ejus perdant quam hodie perire sentio c let god goddess saith destroy worse time feel self perish c saying word destroy perish usd express miserable anguish torment time felt mind tacitus tell u large word death state misery bad worse death may properly enough calld name reason punishment wicked men day judgment book revelation frequently fitly calld second death lake fire wicked shall cast tormented expressely calld second death rev besides argue force word punishment wicked men world shall nothing else utter end necessarily fall two great inconveniencies first hereby exclude positive punishment torment sinner second death destroyd perish signifie nothing else annihilation sinner utter extinction effect dreadful sentence shall passd upon day judgment fire hell quenchd frightful metaphor without meaning directly contrary tenour scripture doth often describe punishment wicked men hell positive torment particularly blessed saviour describing lamentable state damned hell expressely say shall weeping wailing gnashing teeth cannot annihilation meaning effect sentence great day secondly another inconvenience opinion annihilation punishment sinner world punishment sinner must necessity equal degree annihilation notbeing also directly contrary scripture already shewn know well opinion allow long tedious time terrible intolerable torment sinner believe shall utter end must argue force word mentioned plain inference thence annihilation punishment wicked men shall undergo next life true plainly shewn see word expression scripture find lest ground opinion torment wicked men shall last end annihilation yet admitting think ground scripture cannot see great comfort sinner take thought tedious time terrible torment ending last annihilation utter extinction being thirdly may consider primary end threatnings punishment prevention god threaten men may sin punishd may sin may escape punishment threatnd therefore higher threatning run much mercy goodness much likely hinder men incurring penalty threatnd fourthly let considerd likewise plain god hath threatnd eternal misery impenitent sinner prudence world obliges men believe good earnest execute threatnings upon obstinately stand brought repentance therefore reason ought demean self perswade others knowing terrour lord
