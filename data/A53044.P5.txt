moon never respected centre world right line centre always excentrical spot sun moon far able perceive affirmed nothing else flaw stain stony body concerning heat sun one opinion would sun hot self alledging old tradition time break asunder burn heaven consume world hot ember said could done sun fiery self others said opinion could stand reason fire destroyer thing sunstone manner would burn near adjoining body besides said fire cannot subsist without fuel sunstone nothing feed would short time consume self wherefore thought probable sun actually hot onely reflection light heat effect light immaterial opinion laught others rejected ridiculous thought impossible one immaterial produce another believed light heat sun proceeded swift circular motion aethereal globule striking upon optick nerve caused light motion produced heat neither would opinion hold said would follow sight animal cause light eye would light sense reason thus argued concerning heat light sun remarkable none say sun globous fluid body swift circular motion agreed fixt firm like center therefore generally called sunstone empress asked reason sun moon often appear different posture shape sometimes magnified sometimes diminished sometimes elevated otherwhiles depressed thrown right left birdmen answered proceeded various degree heat cold found air whence follow differing density rarity likewise vapour interposed whereof ascend higher le dense ambient air descend heavier dense others probability affirm nothing else various pattern air like painter copy one original alike time said several part air

nevertheless although thinner thinnest vapour yet thin body air else would perceptible animal sight empress asked whether living creature answered yes encrease decrease nourished presence starved

whereof two quite opposite third sideways lastly hut one star said would always kept splendor mentioned two bright one dim thus argued empress began grow angry telescope could give better intelligence said plainly perceive glass false informer instead discovering truth delude sens wherefore command break let birdmen trust onely natural eye examine coelestial object motion sense reason bearmen

without blood better satisfied desired wormmen inform whether observed blood sort worm answered much could perceive blood moth said blood lowse like lobster little vein along back also nit snail maggot well generated cheese fruit produced flesh blood replied empress mentioned creature blood possible live commonly said life animal consists blood seat animal spirit answered blood necessary propriety life animal commonly called animal spirit nothing else corporeal motion proper nature figure animal asked fishand wormmen whether creature blood circulation blood vein artery answered

since animal live respiration air cannot live within water live water cannot live respiration air experience doth sufficiently witness answered majesty different sort creature also different way respiration respiration said nothing else composition division part motion nature infinitely various impossible creature like motion wherefore necessary animal creature bound live either air water onely according nature ordered convenient specie empress seemd well satisfied answer desired informed whether animal creature continue specie successive propagation particular whether every specie
