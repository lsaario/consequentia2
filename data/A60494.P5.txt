second shot find aire stirred first shot also tending towards place shot easie move penetrate already moved open close quiet followeth second shot finding rainge lesser resistance first shoot first second reason first shot powder put piece doth oftentimes find somewhat moist mean powder fire quickly piece dry temperately warm warmth somewhat dry moisture powder cause fire sooner wherefore powder doth work forcibly first shot doth second—the third fourth shot much like second give reason piece grows hotter one shot exceed last every time come shorter shorter piece waxing hotter much hotter
