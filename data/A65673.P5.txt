came near passd earth day deluge began leave preface come matter dispute u first place therefore moses beginning six day creation say darkness upon face deep whereas atmosphere comet suppose chaos meant transparent fluid mr keill argued transparent atmosphere could dark abyss moses answerd moses concern ancient state chaos state commencing creation time would dark abyss properest sense highest degree imaginable mr keill add matter whether light shining central solid calculation thereto relating change pellucid opake fluid restraint word abyss dense fluid alone might omitted first rightly

darkness succeeded light according exact description moses according solution first day work new theory next answer mr keills objection sudden formation earth year time law mechanism since say confusion comet atmosphere seem arise violence heat perihelion heat gradually decreasd would many hundred perhaps thousand year confusion would cease also subsidence mechanical formation compleated proportionably time sooner contrary theory answer seems obscurely expressd mr keill could apprehend meaning therefore shall endeavour explain distinctly thus deny confusion comet atmosphere owing heat perihelion also affirm since astronomer find observation upon comet return solar region atmosphere still return settled formed like planet must contradicted observation ascribd formation earth gradual tedious operation short chaos comet atmosphere atmosphere subside period sun consequently mr keill make objection mistaken formation earth ascribed cause perfected measure imago ought appears assignd

attempt another edition book hypothesis several discovery since made inserted believe fair considering person thought far spoiling beauty theory whatsoever mr keill friend theory general may think contrary proceed mr keill still asserts heat hypothesis fall sun half year least horizon several hundred time greater u present answer alledgd compute quantity heat sun ray equal case assertion must plain error seems meant quite otherwise imagin viz degree heat producd long continuance sun presence would last several hundred time great u present answer sense assertion much truer heat producd fire sun time continually increase perhaps pretty nearly proportion time till suitable competent degree heat producd longer let u try calculation piece wax melt second time suppose distance inch fire degree heat sufficient dissolve texture immediately let u remove distance hundred inch heat ten thousand time weaker ten thousand second near three hour space quantity heat therefore rectangle containd betwixt sine angle incidence case time continuance exactly equal former heat must therefore effect yet presume mr keill believe thus let u compare heat sun equator near pole sine sun angle

refers circular orbit fall theory stand present hypothesis elliptick orbit ti way concernd come point much greater consequence whether dense fluid approach comet deluge would force enough burst earth upper crust situate upon surface dense fluid mr keill mean appearance demonstration urge since first impetus dense fluid infinitely le succeeding impetus acquird motion since room actual motion cannot impetus sufficient break crust otherwise mr keill owns would easily answer say since mr keill disown first original earth fissure breaking crust diurnal rotation ought much le scruple plank board ti cut several piece let piece laid true close possible separated without difficulty upon occasion thus stratum formerly separated continuance diurnal motion permitted join close afterward upon impetus fluid open asserted new theory mr keill imago upper crust earth would hinder force fluid breaking open fissure let u compute force comet attraction upon self see whether even alone without assistance dense fluid would sufficient break manner assignd mr keill may remember coroll 8 post hyp 10 suppose comet deluge half big earth nearest distance center earth 30000 mile let u see force afford towards

exposed business deluge immediately yet region near ark hemisphere deluge must arise forty day rain succeeding flowing water part earth first fell according matter already stated new theory think need
