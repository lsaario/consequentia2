bushel come eight pound every pole ground yield three four bushel root ground good yet may leave enow store ground next year gain much acre may digged six hundred forty bushelsan acre ground yield bushel root sold twelve penny bushel come thirty two pound thus may see profit may made one acre planted root besides ground planted charge trouble unless destroy hardly done neither need dunging

fuel well dryed laid worth dung layes upon plantation must left abroad till christmas often turned dry dry excellent fuel brewing heating oven like us price themas price root think none grudge give twelve penny bushel consider may saved corn five shilling bushel man may much bread two bushel corn make six shilling little cause think dear save four shilling every two bushel besides great deal
