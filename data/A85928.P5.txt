alleadged may contradict passage seemes probably true god hath ordained absolute power written genesis first chapter congregentur aqua quae sub coelo sunt locum unum et appareat arida say let water heaven gathered together one place let dry land appeare earth earth element extream dry moderately cold earth heavier water proved thus cause another yeeld heavinesse ought heavier earth cause water yeeld heavines therfore must need follow earth heavier water proved thus earth stone cast vessell full water descends bottome cause water retire earth stone first bottome vessell water poured therein doth cause retire opposed two considerable objection one water seene motion earth happens rain falling earth passing elementary place must need earth towards alwaies run would happen heavier earth second objection seeing great gulphes water found earth appeares well fountaines therefore followes elementary place water ought earth water draw well enters would say great gulphes water ground sour spring opinion maintained feeble ground shall answer first though name water seene descend earth heavier onely fill pore concavity thereof done may clearly see onely drive superficies earth answer second perennity spring doth proceed great watergulphs ground forasmuch hath thing beene knowne contrary fountain origin sea earth full veines containe water sent sea moisten earth otherwise could produce sundry propriety opening veines make fountaine fountaines engender current many current make river many river floud discharge selfe sea also objected fountain ought brinish salt seawater secondly spring much higher sea motion ought ascend contrary nature water answer saltnesse water purged long narrow trace make within stony sandy place passeth evident greatest part fountaines passe rock since much purer cleaner run fat fenny ground spring incongruous say water ascends sea motion made attraction earth middle world philosopher aristarchus samienus believe earth middle world sunne middle unmovable gave light world philosopher esteeming great absurdity earth produceth infinit number movable animalls unmovable cause worse condition effect opinion hath since renewed copernicus excellent astronomer strive prove revolution contrary proved thus star firmament whether middle heaven towards east towards west appeare alwayes one selfe bignesse would happen earth equally distant earth nearer firmament one place would follow part superficies earth nearest firmament halfe heaven could seene opinion ptolomie philosopher say part soever earth man may see six signes zodiacke rise six descend hinderance thus alwayes halfe heaven seene halfe hidden also proved thus moone go sunne augments light consideration therefore full furthest distance possibly may sunne must necessity diameter heaven halfe heaven sun moone full proved also ecilpses moone moon eclipsed halfe heaven interposed sunne moone moone never eclipse full therefore earth interposed would eclipse since interposition earth shadow made also equinoxe would throughout whole world long artificial dayes would equall long artificiall night infinite number absurdity would follow therefore conclude earth heaviest element hath beene placed lowermost place lowermost place necessity must furthest heaven place furthest heaven cannot center therefore earth center say middle heaven world earth unmovable earth cannot motion move must need eitherbe place circularly center move place motion must either upwards downwards downwards cannot center cannot move upwards nature heavy thing proof mentioned doe suffice would else quit center starres would alwayes appeare selfesame greatnesse absurd therefore hath motion must circularly center neither motion circularly according copernicus opinion must turne axe world axe world must performe course twenty foure houres reason first movable violent motion building would shaken bird cloud seene aire would alwayes incline toward west able follow swift motion earth move way motion never slow towne placed either lesse distant pole would diver elevation circumference motion earth would cause make pole would parallell never happen therefore concluded earth center without motion copernicus answer reason inferres motion twenty foure houres though swift yet neverthelesse hath due proportion may resembled rest boat sit ease though boat swiftly move also evident pale full water may turned aire foure five time without spilling drop yet neverthelesse answer hold forth little purpose since earth performe course twenty foure houres eight thousand league circuit accomplish must make five six league minute houre stone cast aire remaine minute houre ascent descent would fall five six league beyond place whence flung hath never seen heard neverthelesse answer reason sayes earth doth onely turne aire also equall swiftnesse cause earth man aire stone turne equall swiftnesse suppose would happen two inconveniencies experience first man shoot arrow force towards east contrary motion aire man shoot another arrow towards west according motion aire arrow shot towards west motion air go much swifter aire back shot towards west aire contradicts experience selfe second thing supported aire lighter carried heavier lesse transported must therefore follow top tower stone hat flung hat would carried great deale stone also experience maintaine
