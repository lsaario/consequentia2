jesus christ word body meant real presence body host romish doctor assert consequently meant substantial conversion bread body spoken contrary common usage world taken word otherwise men thus prove never author either sacred prophane made use word body signifie substantial conversion one thing another signifie real presence thing immediately pronouncing contrary never man use signifie thing already said example god father speaking jesus christ said beloved son certain jesus christ son god god said common usage never said except thing said example say table mean word table therefore contrary common stile author well sacred prophane contrary common usage men make word jesus christ body signifie substantial conversion bread christ body real presence body host immediately pronouncing priest seeing jesus christ said body speak contrary common usage world take word otherwise men necessarily follows word jesus christ body signifie substantial conversion bread christ body real presence christ body host immediately priest hath pronounced romish doctor must seek passage scripture body prove conversion presence seeing find none conclude conversion presence foundation holy scripture said concerning common usage founded reason viz thing must image picture representation consequently image thing whereof image word image conception conception image thing therefore thing really conceive conceive say therefore jesus christ held gave disciple expressed word body conceived body conceived body said body consequently vertue word body jesus christ gave disciple expressed word body rather blessing bread thanksgiving bread made body christ made sacrament whence follows word body must expounded thus bread body word bread body must expounded thus bread sacrament body prove thus proposition must expounded according nature thing question example man pointing king person say king proposition must expounded thus king person king person meant man coming painter shop pointing king picture say king proposition must expounded thus king picture picture meant even jesus christ laying hand breast said body must without doubt understood proposition concerning real body concerning sign sacrament body meant sign sacrament jesus christ institute eucharist end taken bread blessed given disciple word take eat body evident must understood sacrament body proposition must expounded thus sacrament body sacrament body meant seeing sacrament visible sign invisible grace council trent saith sixth session evident proposition body expounded sacrament body may expounded thus sign body confirm thus two proposition body cup new testament bloud word must taken sense alike pronounced upon matter viz one upon one part sacrament upon part like thing must give like judgment proposition cup new testament word taken real transubstantiated sacramental significative neither cup cup changed testament neither really properly testament sacrament new testament therefore proposition likewise body word taken real transubstantiated sacramental significative consequently proposition cup new testament must expounded thus wine cup sign sacrament new testament proposition body must expounded thus bread sign sacrament body whence follows one single proposition jesus christ institution sacrament eucharist viz cup new testament two figure one word cup taken cup figure called metonymie whereby thing containing taken thing contained figure cup called new testament also figure called metonymie whereby sign called name thing signified therefore romish doctor mistaken tell u jesus christ said instituted eucharist must taken literally without figure withal must imagine jesus christ spake obscurely spake figuratively figure manner speech commonly familiarly used world say word body bloud must expounded thus bread sign sacrament body wine sign sacrament bloud mean bread wine barely simply sign christ body bloud believe bread wine eucharist sign exhibit body bloud christ believer mouth body receive bread wine eucharist time mouth soul viz faith receive body christ broken bloud shed remission sin proved next chapter add hereunto one argument man saith thing whole time imploys saying make false proposition example man saith wall white white whole time imploys saying white make false proposition according romish doctor jesus christ said body body whole time imployed saying body say body afterward therefore according romish doctor jesus christ uttered false proposition blasphemous affirm must lay foundation jesus christ gave disciple said body body said also saying said advantage romish church believe truth word jesus christ body much better believe one time viz said believe three several time viz said saying said may object must take word lord rigorous sense word body must take present tense next future sense immediately body answer romish doctor u take word body rigour literal sense proposition evidently false know present tense may taken next future jesus christ said go father father go god god shall go speedily bold ignorant affirm speech without figure seeing grammarian know figure called enallage time therefore romish doctor must confess doctrine proposition jesus christ body either false figurative seeing false must figurative figure must metonymie whereby sign take name thing signified hath already proved enallage time chap ii concerning exposition word eateth flesh drinketh bloud bath eternal life flesh meat indeed c chapter shall prove jesus christ speaks spiritual eating drinking faith corporal eating drinking mouth body first argument man would satisfie hunger quench thirst eateth drinketh thing hunger thirst eating satisfieth hunger drinking quencheth thirst faith believing jesus christ satisfie hunger quench thirst christ sixth st john cometh shall never hunger believeth shall never thirst therefore faith believing eat drink jesus christ consequently eating christ flesh drinking bloud spiritual corporal second argument jesus christ saith eateth flesh drinketh blood hath eternal life except ye eat flesh son man drink bloud ye life john spiritual eating drinking faith give life eternal corporal eating drinking mouth body many reprobate according doctrine rome self corporally eat flesh drink bloud christ yet shall inherit eternal life third argument taken augustine cardinal cajetan expound word jesus christ st augustin book christian doctrine speaketh thus eat flesh christ figure teaching u partake christ passion imprint memory delight profit christ crucified u card cajetan commentary st john saith eat flesh christ drink bloud faith christ death sense use death son man meat drink ye shall life spirit sufficiently proved exposition add eat drink sacrament thing common well eat unworthily eat worthily jesus christ speaks common saith eateth flesh drinketh bloud hath eternal life saith eateth worthily drinketh worthily eateth drinketh whence clearly appears according letter speaks eating drinking sacrament eucharist eating drinking death jesus christ may clearly understand doctrine must consider wherein life jesus christ give u doth consist seeing flesh jesus christ meat u give u life evident know life life jesus christ give u must know likewise jesus christ meat u consequently eat know life jesus christ give u must consider death involved expressed st paul ephes word dead sin trespass god hath quickned u together christ grace ye saved consequently death involved consists two thing first curse law import privation felicity suffering temporal eternal punishment sin secondly consists habitual corruption whereby sin raigns u therefore said tim widow life pleasure dead liveth also sin called dead work heb life jesus christ hath purchased u consists two thing first deliverance curse law pardon sin st paul tell u colloss god hath quickned together christ forgiven trespass blotting obligation u obligation proceeded law oblige transgressor curse secondly consists regeneration sanctification whereof jesus christ speaking john saith except man born cannot enter kingdom god paul heb without holiness man shall see lord therefore seeing life jesus christ hath purchased u consists pardon sin regeneration sanctification end glorification jesus christ called meat reference life must consider mean whereby jesus christ hath purchased thing u seeing certain death mean hath purchased pardon sin regeneration must conclude jesus christ food nourishment soul regard merit death jesus christ death hath purchased life u justification consists pardon sin regeneration consists holiness life appears passage scripture viz justified bloud christ reconciled god death rom redemption bloud even remission sin ephes hath reconciled u body flesh death may present u holy without spot blameless sight coll sanctified offering body jesus christ heb christ loved church gave might sanctifie cleanse washing water word might present unto glorious church c eph therefore seeing jesus christ hath purchased life u death flesh bloud meat drink purchased life eternal u cross viz remission sin sanctification ending glorification follows action whereby jesus christ applied u righteousness sanctification eat flesh christ drink bloud action nothing else faith scripture tell u justified faith peace god rom god purifies heart faith act believeth hath eternal life joh hath said form argument action whereby obtain remission sin sanctification ending glorification whereby life jesus christ hath purchased u death life principally consists remission sin sanctification proved spiritual eating drinking faith corporal mouth action whereby obtain remission sin sanctification also proved therefore spiritual eating drinking faith action whereby life jesus christ hath purchased u death corporal eating drinking mouth consequently seeing st john certain eating drinking spoken whereby life jesus christ hath purchased u death evident spiritual eating drinking spoken corporal hath said appears jesus christ saith flesh meat indeed c figure fall upon word meat taken corporal spiritual meat reason whereof corporal food appointed nourishment body spiritual food appointed nourishment soul although corporal food taken mouth body yet doth make corporal food except taken nourishment body otherwise poison medicine bullet c man swallow would corporal food absurd affirm flesh christ pretended eaten eucharist mouth body appointed nourishment body food appointed nourishment body changed substance body body christ changed substance body therefore flesh christ corporal food flesh broken bloud shed cross spiritual food nourisheth soul true lively faith embrace flesh broken bloud shed wholy rest rely merit death passion obtaining mercy god certainly seeing life jesus christ give u death spiritual nourishment spiritual eating body drinking bloud spiritual hath proved follows flesh must spiritual meat bloud spiritual drink flesh christ incomparably better truly meat indeed regard effect corporal food doth better perfectly nourish soul believer corporal food doth body corruptible food give temporal life spiritual incorruptible food give life eternal conclude chapter consideration doctrine proposed pretended divine passage holy scripture alledged proof opposeth seems oppose sense reason include contradiction suitable rational sense found passage inconvenience contradiction may avoided nothing embrace probable rational sense reject doctrine opposeth sense reason seems imply contradiction doctrine real presence manhood jesus christ host transubstantiation bread body repugnant sense andreason seems include diver contradiction viz humane body point without local extension body may diver place one time bread wine changed body blood christ accident may without subject c passage impertinently alledged prove presence change sense commodious rational avoiding contradiction appears former chapter rationally expounded two passage romish doctor impertinently make use subject therefore ought embrace commodious rational sense given reject doctrine real presence body jesus christ host doctrine transubstantiation chap iii transubstantiation transubstantiation substantial conversion bread wine body bloud christ destroy diver argument first whereof every substantial conversion thing another thing converted always newly produced example seed converted animal animal newly produced jesus christ turned water wine wine newly produced c body bloud christ cannot newly produced sacrament eucharist therefore bread wine substantially converted body bloud christ sacrament eucharist second proposition viz body bloud christ cannot newly produced prove thus newly produced receives new produce thing give one body bloud christ cannot receive new prove thus man cannot receive hath hath therefore cannot receive hath impossible take away hath impossible give hath already cannot kill dead man cannot give life one living body bloud christ always therefore cannot receive one consequently cannot reproduced eucharist second argument every substantial conversion thing converted another destroyed example water turned wine water destroyed sacrament eucharist bread wine destroyed consecration prove thus celebration eucharist breaking giving eating drinking consecration appears practice adversary consecration break host divide three part give nothing communicant consecrated host eat drink nothing consecrated scripture saith celebration eucharist bread broken bread wine given bread eaten wine drunk appears following passage st paul cor saith bread break communion body christ cor st matth st mark st luke said jesus christ took bread brake gave st mark st matth jesus christ participated sacrament eucharist saith drink fruit vine cor often ye eat bread drink cup let man examine let eat bread drink cup secondly jesus christ said disciple drink ye st matth drink ye cup either commanded drink cup wine cup bloud commanded drink cup wine follows drank nothing wine certain obeyed jesus christ said st mark drank f commanded drink cup bloud follows wine already changed bloud probable jesus christ said drink ye cup bloud yet cup bloud cup wine jesus christ said drink ye speak cup bloud wine converted christ bloud according adversary changed jesus christ made end uttering following word bloud uttered word drink ye uttered bloud man must utter proposition give reason thirdly thing converted another cannot see effect property thing converted converted example seed changed animal see effect property seed animal jesus christ turned water wine effect property accident water seen wine c eucharist cannot consecration perceive effect property accident part body bloud christ see effect property accident bread wine therefore eucharist bread wine converted body bloud christ truth appears bread hath effect accident property bread bread christ body cloathed accident bread may likewise said appear men effect property accident men men horse cloathed accident men fourth argument every substantial conversion must subject pas one substance another would creation sole action doth presuppose subject sacrament eucharist consecration subject according adversary remains subject assert accident bread wine remain without subject therefore sacrament eucharist substantial conversion fifth argument drawn hence transubstantiation destroys nature accident thus doctrine asserts accident accident substance destroys nature essence accident impossible accident substance doctrine transubstantiation asserts accident accident substance prove thus doctrine asserts accident inherent subsist doth assert accident accident substance inherence essential difference accident subsistence essential difference substance doctrine transubstantiation asserts accident inherent subsist prove thus doctrine asserts accident may without subject viz accident bread wine without substance without subject sustain transubstantiation substance bread wine gone accident remain therefore doctrine transubstantiation asserts accident inherent subsist consequently asserts accident accident substance destroys nature essence accident may said actual inherence doth constitute accident aptitudinal form argument whatsoever doth exist actually either exists something else actually cannot without philosopher call actual inherence walking else exists self actually may alone self philosopher term actual existence former constitutes accident latter constitutes substance accident bread wine consecration exist actually therefore must exist either something else actually actually exist actually would subsist real substance impossible therefore exist something else actually viz substance bread wine consequently substance bread wine remains consecration transubstantiation sixth argument drawn transubstantiation destroys nature sacrament every sacrament visible sign invisible grace council trent saith sess every sign relates thing signified must speak sign sacrament thing relating something else relative thing double viz absolute natural thing relative whereby relates something else example man hath begotten child consider absolute natural man others relative whereby father distinguished men child father sacrament baptism sign viz water hath absolute natural viz cold moist substance whereby water water relative sacramental significative whereby sign sacrament christ bloud differs water imployed sacred use even sacrament eucharist bread wine sign natural absolute viz substance whereby bread wine bread wine commonly use relative sacramental significative whereby sacrament sign body bloud christ differ bread wine thus imployed add impossible relative without absolute relative cannot without foundation example impossible father without man equal without quantity c granted form argument thus take away natural sign sacrament destroys nature essence relative sacramental cannot without absolute natural hath proved doctrine transubstantiation destroys natural bread wine sign sacrament christ body bloud transubstantiation whole substance bread wine destroyed therefore doctrine transubstantiation destroys nature essence sacrament argument adversary answer eucharist bread wine sign consecration destroyed substance say sign accident bread wine others say body bloud christ contained accident bread wine sign body bloud jesus christ crucified lastly others say neither accident bread wine body bloud christ body bloud christ together accident bread wine sign body bloud jesus christ crucified therefore seeing doctrine transubstantiation doth destroy natural christ body bloud natural accident bread wine maintain doctrine transubstantiation doth destroy nature essence sacrament reply neither accident bread wine body bloud christ body bloud christ together accident bread wine true sign jesus christ crucified bread wine prove thus first sacrament ought analogy similitude sign thing signified adversary confess particularly card bellarmin book sacrament chap word fourth thing required sacrament sign similitude analogy thing signified quote st augustine epist boniface speaking thus sacrament similitude thing whereof sacrament could sacrament sacrament eucharist neither accident bread wine body bloud christ whether jointly severally similitude analogy thing signified required bread wine substance principally signified represented sign sacrament eucharist nourishment soul hope eternal life baptism sacrament regeneration spiritual birth eucharist sacrament spiritual nourishment card bellarmin confesseth book eucharist chap book chap saith sacrament eucharist ordained preserve spiritual life cannot represented signified sign nourish body analogy similitude consists sign vertue nourish body preservation temporal life thing signified vertue nourish soul hope eternal life neither accident bread wine body bloud christ whether severally jointly accident nourish body nourishment essentially conversion aliment substance living body certain neither accident bread wine body bloud christ whether separately jointly converted substance substance bread wine aliment take therefore neither accident bread wine body bloud christ whether separately jointly true sign bread wine ordinary nourishment body represent u spiritual nourishment soul body bloud christ received faith secondly council trent session command sacrament eucharist shall adored latrie according adversary sovereign worship due god accident bread wine ought adored creature god must adored therefore accident bread wine sacrament eucharist thirdly sacrament visible sign invisible grace council trent defines session eucharist body bloud christ visible therefore eucharist body bloud christ sign lastly say every sacrament sign relates thing signified relation always two different thing nothing relates self consequently nothing sign thing signified body bloud christ thing signified therefore body bloud christ sign purpose say jesus christ mass sign figure cross jesus christ wheresoever one yesterday day ever therefore jesus christ different cannot relative sign reason usually alledged transubstantiation properly mentioned next chapter chap iv real presence christ body host consecrated wafer romish doctor affirm immediately priest celebration mass hath pronounced word body body christ really present host whole entire every part point host doctrine destroy following argument first whreof thing created place either must produced must come brought thither place impossible find third way putting thing place romish doctor hitherto able invent one two way putting christ body host jacobin telling u brought thither place jesuites produced body christ neither come brought thither host produced therefore body christ host first body christ cannot come brought host place come place heaven heaven christ body neither come brought heaven host prove thus body come carried one place another must leave first place example man would go paris rome must leave paris body jesus christ never leaf heaven heaven must contain time restitution thing act therefore christ body neither come brought heaven host besides impossible christ body come brought host without passing space heaven earth consecrated host man cannot pas one extream another without passing space space heaven earth vast passed moment doctor immediately pronouncing word body body christ brought host moreover must moment heaven air highest heaven earth host man cannot pas place without would three sort existence viz one natural glorious existence heaven one sacramental existence host one airy existence air seeing thing absurd must conclude christ body neither come brought host secondly christ body cannot reproduced consecrated host thing produced already cannot produced without preceding destruction dead man cannot killed annihilated annihilated already neither produced produced already receive hath one already common conception men founded upon principle every action whether produceth destroyeth thing must necessarily two distinct term one called school terminus quo term thing come terminus ad quem term come according principle cannot annihilated already receive hath one already term come term come would one thing contrary maxime already laid viz term action must necessarily distinct one must negation privation perhaps may objected transubstantiation substance christ body newly produced new presence place substance bread answer substantial conversion action new substance must produced accidental new accident must produced transubstantiation according romish doctor substantial conversion therefore transubstantiation new substance must produced seeing new presence christ body place substance bread substance accident catagorie philosopher call vbi evident transubstantiation presence christ body produced place substance bread seeing substance christ body produced hath proved preceding number must conclude transubstantiation real presence christ body host instance doth also destroy adduction christ body host hath already refuted number second argument true humane body christ body something something right left behind head neck neck shoulder shoulder breast breast stomach stomach belly belly thigh thigh leg c world know point nothing right left behind therefore christ body point consequently every point part host add quantity greatness christ body nothing else length breadth thickness cannot point lastly quantity christ body nothing else extent know body extended hath part one without another one within another jesuites expound doctrine presence christ body host put part one within another put point therefore doctrine take away extent consequently quantity third argument move move time eaten eaten time point point time occupy place occupy time contradictory thing body christ diver consecrated host would move move time example priest carry consecrated host sick person body christ pretended move host leaf altar go priest toward sick person house time body christ pretended host remain altar move body christ time move move contradiction seeing impossible one body one time move move likewise impossible christ body diver host time like manner christ body time heaven host would eaten eaten time would eaten host priest time would eaten heaven also would point point time host would point heaven would point time therefore seeing impossible one body one time eaten eaten point point also impossible christ body heaven host time fourth argument two relative always different father son husband wife c relation always two thing really differ equality two ell resemblance two crow c word nothing relation self whatsoever hath relation must necessarily something else appears definition relation distant relative absolute term conceive absolute term conceive one thing conceive crow conceive relative term necessarily conceive two thing example cannot conceive crow like without conceiving something else like seeing cannot conceive thing distant without conceiving something else distant evident distant relative term distant thing relative consequently really different whence form argument relative thing really different hath proved body rome distant paris reason space league two city body highest heaven distant upon earth reason many thousand league heaven earth therefore body rome different paris heaven different upon earth consequently one body cannot time rome paris heaven upon earth else one body might distant different self contradiction therefore seeing jesus christ distant different follows cannot time heaven host time consecrated host rome paris perhaps may said body time two distant place distant self place distant therefore christ body heaven distant self host place viz heaven earth host distant answer distance place make distance thing existing distant place example reason peter rome distant paul paris two thing really different else would always distant even one bed together always really different reason distance two distant place seeing according adversary christ body two distant place viz heaven host rome paris diver host follows christ body distant different self seeing impossible distant different self evident cannot two distant place consequently heaven host besides suppose peter could rome paris peter rome mind go paris go accordingly peter paris mind go rome go accordingly certain peter would draw near meet thing draw near must necessity distance therefore body draw near self certain distant self hereupon would fain ask adversary whether peter meet would let pas let pas whether peter going rome would step aside give way going paris else contrary step aside give place would ask whether would hinder passing hinder passing whether would pas thorow make another janus two face c whatsoever answer shall make question must sure absurd ridiculous fifth argument perfect contradiction body one one christ body time heaven upon earth host would one one would one adversary confession would one prove thus thing may one must neither divided self self appears definition unity certain nothing divided separated self christ body time heaven upon earth host divided separated self heaven divided separated upon earth space may objected body diver place divided self locally place divided entitatively still one entity body answer entitative division nothing else plurality being plurality thing really different true division three divine person really different would also really divided body soul living man really differ would also really divided say body divided separated body toucheth also divided separated body doth touch body divided separated body near also divided separated body far distant especially division true two body diver nature union therefore seeing christ body really heaven body pretendedly upon earth consecrated host diver body diver nature united evident adversary doctrine christ body really divided separated self seeing impossible separated self also impossible heaven host time say local division take away entitative division thing divided locally also divided entitatively also really different else reason given two glass water taken fountain really different seeing water like thing except reference place reason given ocean one single drop water reproduced place occupied ocean except one drop water cannot reproduced place possible reason obligeth u believe really god nature nothing vain vain many thing may done one thing really follows seabattles ever fought one drop water many thousand men drowned one drop water people since adam drunk one drop water thing absurd ridiculous sixth argument jesus christ man cannot diver place another man cannot jesus christ man made like unto u thing sin excepted apostle hebrew observes another man cannot diver place example peter cannot time paris rome prove thus impossible peter man man time peter could time paris rome might time man man prove thus may time dead alive may time man man alive real man dead real man carcass peter could time paris rome might alive dead time might mortally wounded paris die time hurt rome alive making merry besides peter might divisibly paris indivisibly rome christ body according adversary divisibly heaven indivisibly host paris divisibly head cut would die cease man rome indivisibly point head cut remain time living real man contradiction word peter might paris midst flame burnt reduced ash consequently die man whereas time might rome river tiber sound brisk consequently true living man whence follows might man man contradiction may added absurdity would follow position one body may diver place viz one candle lighted might give light world reproduced place world great army might made one man reproduced hundred thousand adjoining place debt world might paid one crown reproduced many time crown due people world might quench thirst one pottle wine reproduced many time inhabitant world men world might drink one glass reproduced many time men world whereupon man might curious ask whether glass broken paris would also broken rome constantinople place one man reproduced hundred thousand place might time marry hundred thousand wife lie whereupon man might desire know whether woman might conceive every one delivered child end nine month consequently may said one man one night beget hundred thousand child c seventh argument christ body host would seen glory romish doctor say would visibly conversed amongst men glory christ body doth principally consist brightness splendor extraordinary light like upon mount tabor dare affirm glorious body visible wheresoever yet certain christ body seen host evident sign may said christ body accident bread accident hide u answer according adversary christ body place substance bread substance bread accident accident bread upon substance substance bread accident two different place two several difference place c therefore christ body cannot accident bread consequently accident hide u seeing adversary say christ body every part point host must need superficies consequently cannot hid covered accident bread may said christ body glorious luminous visible self god hinders u seeing answer god hinders pleased consequently pleased hinder would would permit seen posture host whereupon would ask adversary posture would seen whether sitting standing lying posture whether would posture posture must without external form posture situation absolutely depends upon external form man seen without external form man without posture man christ body without posture without external form seeing adversary say whole entire whole host occupies whole space great host sitting standing posture external form man say whole entire point host follow man may seen sitting standing point seeing man standing hath head foot follow jesus christ seen point host head foot though point nothing add could seen host would appear big host would occupy whole space host would appear round would bounded space host occupies round besides host divided two equal part would appear le one half form half circle would whole entire half host occupy space would also appear hundred thousand time le hundred thousand several form say whole entire hundred thousand part host occupies space word never monstrous thing seen world christ body would really host manner adversary affirm eighth argument either manhood jesus christ pretended host act cannot cannot act follows cannot see hear know love exercise function sensitive rational soul manhood christ host know nothing love nothing follows happy happiness chiefly consists knowledge love god also manhood christ host different manhood heaven know heaven time know nothing host love heaven love nothing host see heaven see nothing host christ manhood act host doth heaven follow open eye move foot point according adversary whole entire every point host tell u god easily put whole world point doth whole manhood christ point host follow part world existing point may action vast space part christ manhood existing point host action heaven le space occupied grain corn sun may move east west sea may flouds ebb english may seafight spaniard word sparrow may easily swallow world seeing world occupy much space grain corn doth yet world shall swallow great atpresent even christ body host big tall cross adversary affirm ninth argument body cannot place except produced come brought thither place body cannot cease place without destroyed going place consequently christ body ceaseth host consumption accident must necessarily either perish go place christ body cannot perish jesus christ dieth rom christ body go place go place would go heaven cannot go heaven already man cannot go place already therefore christ body doth cease host whence follows either christ body still remains host impossible consumed else never host every one know experience host eaten consumed christ body cannot consumption accident bread therefore never host tenth argument drawn hence pretended presence christ body host destroys nature christ body thus property specie incommunicable every specie example property man incommunicable beast seeing

mass accident bread wine fall sens find experience therefore body bloud christ pretended accident bread wine thing sacrificed second argument every true sacrifice thing sacrificed must utterly destroyed must changed must cease bellarmin saith express term place cited pretended sacrifice mass christ body bloud destroyed jesus christ dieth rom therefore pretended sacrifice mass body bloud christ thing sacrificed two argument bellarmin book mass ch romish doctor answer christ body simply thing sacrificed mass christ body specie bread reference specie bread christ body sensible visible secondly answer sacrifice mass christ body destroyed respect sacramental respect natural eaten sacrament ceaseth specie bread answer reply first christ body visible specie bread adversary say hide u

unconsecrated host ti ridiculous shift say christ body visible specie bread specie visible cannot see wine hogshead see hogshead cannot see money purse closed see purse neither see body specie bread see specie adversary say specie hinders u seeing secondly say sacramental understood accidental jesus christ example presence sacrament else besides understood substantial substantial also understood seeing substantial thing nothing else substance nature follow jesus christ destroyed sacrament eucharist respect substantial must also destroyed respect natural contrary apostle saith rom jesus christ dieth accidental jesus christ understood example presence sacrament absurdity follow viz first sacrifice mass sacrifice accident jesus christ presence jesus christ jesus christ accident secondly follow sacrifice mass cross sacrifice reference thing sacrificed jesus christ presence thing jesus christ substance presence accident contrary decision council trent hath determined sacrifice mass cross reference thing sacrificed thirdly follow thing destroyed sacrament produced accident destroyed whereas substance produced transubstantiation substantial conversion hath sufficiently proved fourthly follow sacrifice mass offered priest stomach presence destroyed till priest hath eaten host consequently sacrifice mass offered mass presence destroyed destruction accident commonly accident destroyed till mass said fifthly follow justice god cease whereas heretofore could satisfied death christ destruction natural god appeased sin expiated god justice satisfied destruction sacramental sacrifice mass propitiatory sin living dead third argument drawn word apostle heb almost thing law purged bloud without shedding bloud remission therefore necessary pattern thing heaven purified heavenly thing better sacrifice word form argument propitiation remission sin without sheding bloud apostle saith mass sheding bloud called unbloudy sacrifice therefore mass propitiation remission sin consequently propitiatory sacrifice sin argument may thus confirmed old testament propitiation purification without sheding bloud type heavenly thing purified apostle saith heb therefore new testament also propitiation purification without sheding bloud heavenly thing represented legal type must purified excellent sacrifice viz sheding christ bloud although apostle useth word sacrifice plural number yet must understand sacrifice christ cross one thing opposed many often expressed plural number baptism one called baptism heb sacrifice cross christ text cited heb opposed old sacrifice type figure sacrifice cross fourth argument drawn word apostle heb covenant make day saith lord put law heart mind write sin iniquity remember remission offering sin whence form argument remission sin need oblation propitiatory sacrifice sin apostle saith christian church vertue new testament new covenant confirmed bloud christ remission sin heb therefore christian church adays need oblation propitiatory sacrifice consequently need sacrifice mass fifth argument drawn word apostle heb jesus christ offereth often high priest entereth holy place every year bloud others must often suffered foundation world end world hath appeared put away sin sacrifice appointed men die judgment christ offered bear sin many unto look shall appear second time without sin unto salvation confirmed word apostle heb law shadow good thing come image thing never sacrifice offered year year continually make comer thereunto perfect would ceased offered worshiper purged conscience sin remembrance made sin every year possible bloud bull goat take away sin c every high priest standeth dayly ministring offering often time sacrifice never take away sin man offered one sacrifice sin ever sate right hand god one offering hath ever perfected sanctified conformable said little sanctified offering body jesus christ form argument first old sacrifice reiterated apostle saith high priest entereth holy place every year bloud others sacrifice jesus christ must reiterated apostle saith jesus christ offereth often hath appeared put away sin sacrifice therefore sacrifice mass sacrifice cross reiterated reiteration sacrifice cross adversary would secondly apostle adding else often suffered foundation world make apparent christ cannot offered without suffering say fire else would hot doth necessarily presuppose fire hot say man else would rational doth necessarily presuppose man rational apostle saith jesus christ offereth often otherwise often bave suffered doth necessarily presuppose jesus christ cannot offer without suffering jesus christ doth suffer every day mass therefore offered every day mass ministry priest thirdly word foundation world great weight ti much apostle said sacrifice christ cross sufficient take away sin shall committed hereafter follows sufficient take away sin committed heretofore creation world unsuitable sacrifice christ cross vertue offered since sacrifice christ cross vertue take away sin otherwise saith apostle often suffered foundation world therefore hath also vertue take away sin committed since consequently need reiterated mass fourthly apostle comparison considerable sense whereof men suffer death death appear till day resurrection day judgment christ hath offered father cross take away sin earth come judge quick dead utterly destroys mass jesus christ said offered sacrificed continually ministry priest fifthly sacrifice take away sin sanctifie come thereunto ought reiterated reason apostle alledgeth old sacrifice law reiterated could take away sin sanctifie comer thereunto appears text cited sacrifice jesus christ cross take away sin sanctifies come thereunto therefore sacrifice jesus christ cross ought reiterated consequently reiterated mass jesus christ offer sacrifice cross might sanctifie u ever purchase eternal redemption u evident fruit efficacy sacrifice endures ever must recourse sacrifice cross jesus christ offer sacrifice cross might sanctifie u ever purchase eternal redemption u appears text aforesaid therefore efficacy sacrifice cross endures ever must recourse sacrifice cross word either must confess sacrifice cross hath vertue take away sin sanctifie u ever contrary apostle saith else hath vertue sufficiency jesus christ hath offered one sacrifice consequently offered dayly mass ministry priest lastly apostle almost throughout whole epistle hebrens saith jesus christ constituted consecrated father high priest ever particularly chap saith many made priest suffered continue reason death jesus christ continueth forever hath unchangeable priesthood able save uttermost come unto god seeing ever liveth make intercession consequently hath need vicar companion priesthood answer argument romish doctor wont say sacrifice mass cross respect essence sacrifice thing offered viz body bloud christ priest viz jesus christ differs respect manner offering cross jesus christ offered bloudily died shed bloud mankind mass offer unbloudily without sheding bloud without dying cross jesus christ destroyed respect natural mass destroyed respect sacramental add argument drawn epistle hebrew respect bloudy oblation offered cross besides bloudy sacrifice another unbloudy daily offered mass lastly say sacrifice cross primitive original mass representative commemorative applicative cross council hath session distinction reply sacrifice mass doth differ cross respect manner accidental difference differs respect essence first natural death jesus christ essence sacrifice cross sacrifice mass doth comprehend natural death jesus christ jesus christ dieth rom therefore sacrifice mass doth comprehend essence sacrifice cross consequently differs essentially respect manner secondly representation thing differs essentially thing represented example king picture differs essentially king also memorial thing differs essentially thing whereof memorial example celebration passover memorial angel favourable passing house israelite differs essentially passing lastly application thing differs essentially example application plaister differs essentially plaister according determination council trent session sacrifice mass representative commemorative applicative cross therefore sacrifice mass differs essentially cross thirdly sacrifice cross infinite value consequently ought reiterated value infinite sufficient take away sin past present come bellarmin saith book mass chap sacrifice mass finite price value according bellarmin romish doctor may justly wonder seeing adversary say differs sacrifice cross either respect thing sacrificed respect chief priest yet sacrifice hath price value secondly say unbloudy propitiatory sacrifice feigned imaginary thing argument drawn epistle hebrew wholy destroy first said heb without sheding bloud remission sin therefore unbloudy sacrifice mass remission sin consequently cannot propitiatory sacrifice sin secondly jesus christ cannot offered without suffering apostle saith heb jesus christ offereth often otherwise often suffered sacrifice jesus christ suffering bloudy sacrifice therefore unbloudy sacrifice thirdly bloudy sacrifice cross infinite value hath purchased eternal redemption heb hath taken away sin past present come whence follows sacrifice either bloudy unbloudy purchase pardon sin sacrifice cross sufficiently done fourthly justice god requires sin shall expiated punishment due true wrath god could appeased bloudy ignominious death cross therefore justice god must changed nature sin expiated mass without pain suffering thirdly distinction primitive sacrifice offered cross representative commemorative applicative daily offered mass reply first council trent saith session viz eucharist sacrifice representative commemorative applicative mass may bear good sense viz representation commemoration application sacrifice cross viz representation bread broken represents body broken wine poured cup represents bloud christ shed remission sin commemoration done done remembrance jesus christ death according command word remembrance according st paul saith cor often ye eat bread drink cup ye shew
