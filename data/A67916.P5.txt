number pound starling quotient like proportion flemmish ell english ell ell flemmish ell english c q like reason thing yea whether coin weight measure c q remainder division must bee exprest fraction rule three q use next use shall apply rule proportion commonly called rule three usefulnes golden rule q doth rule three teach teacheth known number finde fourth either continual proportion discontinual proportion q call continual proportion number hold proportion among proportion first hath second like hath second third third fourth also c q finde number continual proportion multiply second number self divide product first number quotient desire q agrees former word said rule teacheth three number finde fourth well second number taken twice second third fourth number found third number continual proportion q shew example thus give give multiply give divided first number quotient third number continual proportion number q finde fourth number continual proportion may either multiply third self divide second else multiply second third together divide first quotient desire q give example take former number first former way multiply self viz thus come fourth secondly multiply second third together divide first thus come q discontinual proportion first second hold like proportion third fourth second third hold proportion together q fourth number discontinual proportion found multiplying second number third dividing first q use may bee made proportional thus found may bee applied many us according several imployments men exercised merchandizing measuring height distance magnitude quantity c q may bee applied thus yard cloth cost yard cost rate yard first number second yard third therefore multiply second third come divided first quotient demand q shall know number ought bee first may mistake work false must observe first number third one kinde ought bee reduced one denomination second number kinde sought question first second declare proportion third number annexed demand q make plainer example former example yard yard one kinde wit yard second middle number another kinde namely shilling yard declare proportion first second number demand joyned cost yard third number fourth number resolving question kinde second wit shilling q number bee several denomination l sd c must bee reduced one denomination first apply rule second middle number must bee reduced denomination smallest part part question resolved fourth number q give example hereof yard quarter cost cost yard first third number measure must bee turned q quartern first bee third second middle number must turned penny bee work rule multiply second third together set order thus q quartern cost cost q quartern divide product first come solution penny like middle number reduce shilling pound thus come solution2l8s q reduce smallest part denomination greater part kinde easie estimation value backer rule three q manner work rule three yea another manner work called backer rule three q called backer rule three former wee multiply second third divide first wee multiply first second divide third number q use rule serveth finde number hold proportion first
