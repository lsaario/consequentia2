objection every man may judge nothing confusion religion end controversy universal infallible judge necessary without god made sufficient provision assurance men faith peace unity church expressed canon law liter dominus non videretur fuisse discretus otherwise lord seemd discreet plausible soever objection may appear despair men lay aside prejudice impartially consider thing make abundantly evident ground sufficient found infallible judge upon therefore answer desire following particular may considered first say rather prof god done according fancy hath really actually done text expresly bid christian try spirit man sense imply may judge matter church rome say may liberty permitted god ordered thing wisely best peace unity church apostle say another case art thou man objectest god secondly reasoning good may well conclude universal infallible judge set whole world temporal matter whose authority mankind bound submit necessary peace world peace church men surely every whit apt
