sive thesaurus christi apostolorum ejus denunciamus vobis dominis communibus praesentis parliamenti certas quaestiones veritates pro reformatione sanctae ecclesiae anglicanae quae caecum extitit leprosa annis plurimis per manutenentiam superbae praelaciae supportatae adulationibus privatarum religionum sive privatae religionis multiplicatae ad magnum onus est effectus populisonerosus anglia secunda conclusio hanc continet sententiam quando ecclesia anglicana incoepit delirare possessione temporalium secundum novercam suam magnam romanam ecclesiam ecclesiae mortificatae erant sive occisae per appropriationem diversorum locorum fides spes caritas coeperunt fugere extra ecclesiam nostram quia superbia cum sua prole perversa peccatorum mortalium vendicabant ecclesiam nostram titulo haereditario ista quaestio est generalis probata ut dicunt experientia ut audies sequentibus haec est secunda quaestio sacerdotium nostrum usuale quod incoepit civitate romana ficta altioris potestatis potestate anglica non est sacerdotium christo suis discipulis ordinatum probatur sic haec quaestio sacerdotium romanum fictum cum signis ritibus ac episcoporum benedictionibus est pravae virtutis nullibi sacrum scriptura exemplatum quia ordinalia sine rubricae episcoporum pravae sunt fidei vel autoritatis novo testamento nescimus videre quod spiritus sanctus dat dona sua propter aliqua talia signa quia ipse nobilia dona sua stare non possunt cum peccato mortali aliqua una persona corrolaria hujus quaestionis est quod valde extraneum sive novum est pluribus hominibus sapientibus videre episcopos ludere cum spiritu sancto suorum ordinum collatione quia corona conferunt caracteribus loco servorum alborum illa est liberata antichristi sive ejus signum istam ecclesiam introductum ad otium palliandum tertia quaestio dolorosa est ista lex continentiae sacerdotio annexa quae praejudicium foeminarum fuit primitus introducta inducit sodomiam universalem sanctam ecclesiam sed per bibliam excusamus no propter suspectum decretum quod dicit quia nem non deberemus nominar peccatum ratio experientia hanc probat quaestionem quia deliciosi cibi potus ecclesiasticorum requirit necessariam purgationem naturalem vel pejorem experientia occultae probationis talium ergo non habent delectationem mulieribus cum talem repereris nota enim bene quia ipse estunus exillis correlaria hujus quaestionis est quod dignum valde esset adnullare privatas religiones hujus peccati incoeptores sed deus ex sua magna potestate de peccatis privatis manifestam sumat vindictam quarta quaestio quae plus damnificat populum innocentem est quia fictum miraculum sacri panis inducitomnes homines paucis exceptis ad idolatriam quia ipsi aestimant quod corpus domini quod nunquam exibit coelum virtute verborum sacerdotis sit exiguo pane quem ipsi populo ostendunt sed utinam vellent credere quod doctor evangelicus dicit suo trialogo quia panis altaris est habitudinaliter corpus christi quia supponimus quod isto momento potest quilibet vir foemina lege divina conficere sacramentum panis sine aliquo talus miraculo correlarium hujus quaestionis est quod si corpus christi sit dotatum gloria aeterna officium corporis christi compositum per sanctum thomam non est verum depictum plenum falsis miraculis hoc non est mirum quia frater thomas illo tempore tenens cum papa voluit fecisse miraculum de ovo gallinae bene novimus quod quodlibet mendacium aperte praedicatum cedit illi verecundiam injuriam qui semper est fidelis sine defectu quinta quaestio est haec exorcismi sanctificationes consecrationes sive benedictiones factae ecclesia sanctum vini panis aqua olei salis cerei incensi sive thuris mensae altaris murorum ecclesiae vestimentorum mitrae baculi pastoralis baculorum peregrinorum hujusmodi vera practica sunt nigromanciae potius quam sanctae theologiae haec quaestio probatur sic per tale exorcismos consecrationes creaturae sunt oneratae esse altioris virtutis quam sunt ex natura propria nihil mutationis vide u hujusmodi creaturis exorcizatis vel consecratis nisi per falsam fidem quae est principale omni arte diabolica correlarium si liber qui exorcizat aquam benedictam aspersam ecclesiam dei esset totus verus nobis videtur veraciter quia aqua benedicta sanctum ecclesia usitata optimum esset medicina cujus contrarium experimur sexta quaestio quae sustentat multam superbiam est quod rex pontifex eadem persona praelatus judex temporalis causae curatus officiarius servicio mundiali quod libet regnum reddit sine regula debita vel convenienti regimine haec quaestio probatur sic potestas temporalis spiritualis sunt duae partes totius sanctae ecclesiae eo qui se uni eorum deputavit non deberet se interponere cum altero quia nemo potest duobus dominis servire nobis videtur quod hermefodrita vel ambidexter esset conveniens nomen talibus hominibus duplicis status correlarium no procuratores dei ista causa instamus prosequimur ac petimus isto parliamento quod omnesmodi curatores tam alti quam basso sint plene excusati abomni officio temporali se occupent cum curis suis de nullis aliis se interponant septima quaestio quam no potenter affirmamus est quod speciales orationes factae ecclesia nostra pro animabus defunctorum proferendo unum ex nomine potius quam alium est falsum fundamentum elemosinae super quod omnes domus elemosinariae anglia male fundantur haec quaestio probatur duplici ratione primo quia oratio meritoria valoris deberet esse opus procedens ex alta caritate perfecta caritas non accipit persona quia diliges proximum c quia propter nobis videtur donatio bonorum temporalium collatorum sacerdotibus domibus elemosinariis est causa principalis hujusmodi orationum specialium quae non multum distat simonia quia speciales orationes factae pro hominibus damnatis ad poenam aeternam multum deo displicent quamvis dubium sit tamen verisimile est fideli populo quod fundationes domorum elemosinariarum propter ipsorum venenosam dotationem pro majori parte transiissent viam latam correlarium oratio valoris procedens perfecta caritare debet se extendere generali ad omnes quos deus vult salvare dimittere debent mercancias orationum spiritualium modo usitatarum pro mortuis hominibus factas mendicantibus possessionatis aliis presbyteris peculiaribus animarum qui sunt populus magni oneris toti regno manutenentes otio quia probatum extitit quodam libro quem rex audivit quod centum domus elemosinarum sufficerent toti regno ex hoc contingeret maximum commodum possibile parti temporali octava quaestio necessaria referri populo decepto peregrinationes orationes oblationes caecis imaginibus crucifixi surdis imaginibus de ligno lapide sunt propinquae naturae idolatriae multum distant ab operibus caritatis sive elemosinae quamvis prohibitae imago sint liber erroris populo laicali adhuc imagine sanctae trinitatis usualis est maxime abominabilis hanc quaestionem deus aperte monstravit mandando operam misericordiae fieri hominibus indigentibus quia ipsi sunt imago dei majori similitudine quam lignum vel lapis quia deus non dixit faciamus lignum vel lapidem c sed hominem ad similitudinem nostram quia altus honor latria clericis vocatus solo debetur deitati honor vocatus dulia debetur homini vel angelis aliis creaturis inferioribus correlarium officium de ligno crucis bi anno celebratum nostra ecclesia est plenum idolatria quia si lignum crucis christi lancea clavi essent tanto honore venerandi tunc labium judae proditoris solennes essent reliquiae si quis posset illa obtinere sed no rogamus te peregrine quam oblationem facis ossibus sanctorum incrismatorum aliquo loco ut intendis relevare indulgentiam sanctam coelo vel domus pauperis elemosinariae quae ita bene dotatur qui deus novit quomodo homines qui modo canonizantur ut apertius loquamur fideles christi supponunt quod puncta propter quae moriebatur nobilis vir quem homines appellant sanctum thomam non sunt causa martyrii nec fuerunt nona quaestio quae deprimit populum est quod articulus confessionis dictus necessarius hominum salvationi cum potestate ficta vel praetensa absolutionis exaltat sacerdotum superbiam dat ii opportunitatem occultae vocationis alterius quam dicere volumus praesenti quia domini dominae sunt arrestati propter timorem suorum confessorum qui non audent dicere veritatem tempus confessionis est tempus valde aptum precationi continuationis peccatorum mortalium dicunt etiam se esse commissarios dei ad judicandum de quolibet peccato ad deformandum purgandum illos quos volunt dicunt se habere claves coeli inferni excommunicare possunt vel benedicere ligare vel solvere secundum prepriam eorum voluntatem tantum quod propter bursellum frumenti vel duodecim denarios annuatim ipsi volunt vendere gloria regni coelestis cum clausa warantisationis sigillata communi sigillo eorum haec quaestio est visa usu quae alia non indiget probatione correlarium papa romanus se fingit altum thesaurarium totius ecclesiae habens dignum jocale passionis christi custodia cum meritis omnium sanctorum coeli per quod dat fictam indulgentiam poena culpa est thesaurizarius maxime bannitus extra caritatem ex quo potest liberare omnes prisinarios existentes poenis ad voluntatem propriam scriptum facere nunquam venire ibidem sed quamlibet christianus fidelis bene potest videre quod multa secreta falsitas est abscondita ecclesia nostra haec est decima quaestio homicidium per bellum vel per legem justiciae aliquam praetensam perpetratum propter causam temporalem vel spiritualem sine speciali revelatione expresse est contrarium novo testamento quod est lex gratiae plenum misericordiae haec quaestio manifeste probatur exemplo christi praedicantis hic terra qui maxime docuit dimittere inimicis misereri adversariorum non occidere eos cujus ratio est pro majori enim parte quando homines pugnant post primum ictum dirumpitur caritas quicunque caritate morte exuitur transit rectum via ad inferna et ultra hoc no bene novimus quod nullus clericus scit per sacram scripturam invenire vel rationem legalem ostendere quod poena mortis est infligenda potius uni peccato mortali quam alteri sed lex misericordiae quae est novum testamentum prohibet omne homicidium evangelio dictum est antiquitus non occides correlarium est sanctum spoliatio pauperis populi quando domini premant indulgentias poena culpa hiis qui subsidia conferunt exercitui eorum collecto ad interficiendum christianum populum terris remotis propter bona temporalia obtinenda sicut alias fieri vidimus milites qui discurrunt ad paganiam vel sarracenos ad obtinendum sibi magnum nomen occisione hominum acquirunt sibi indignationem magnam regis pacis quia per humilitatem tolerantiam lex nostra extitit multiplicata pugnatores ac homicidas odit christus eisdem minatur dicens qui gladio percutit gladio peribit conclusio undecima verecunda dictum votum continenciae factum nostra ecclesia mulieribus quae sunt fragiles inperfectae natura est causa horribilissimi peccati possibilis naturae humanae quia quamvis occisio puerorum ante baptismum eorum procuratio aborcii aut destructio seminum ante formatum foetum facta per medicinas sint gravia peccata valde adhuc conjunctio mutua foeminarum contra naturam actu carnali vel earum coitus cum bestia irrationali vel cum creatura insensibili non viva transcendit demeritoria actione dignum poenis inferni correlarium no vellemus quod viduae tale quae voverunt castitatem investitae annulo mantello deliciose pastae vel delicate nutritae essent desponsatae quia ea nescimus excusare de occultis peccatis duodecima quaestio multitudo artium non necessariarum homini nostra ecclesia multum peccatum nutrit superflua curiositate diffiguratione hominum per vestes curiosa hoc ostendit experientia ratio probat quia natura cum paucis artibus sufficeret humanae naturae correlarium ex quo apostolus paulus dicit habentes victum quibus tegamur contenti sim nobis videtur quod aurifabri fabri armorum omnia genus artium non necessariarum homini secundum apostolum destrui debent propter augmentum virtutum quia quamvis istae duae artes nominatae necessariae fuerunt veteri lege novum tamen testamentum artes cum multis allis evacuavit pore men tresorers christ apostels denouncyn lordes commens parliament certeyn conclusion
