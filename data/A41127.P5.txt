furnished something nature fiery medicine well prepared may good aqua vitae like recover instantly quantity doth drink intoxicate repaireth presently chief residence life assist go along may seen man tyred drink good draught aqua vitae gathereth strength presently therefore ignorantly spoken would burn man fire cannot burn fire fire refreshed fire increase one another rejoycing mutually one nature water cold thing quench unity fire nay death fire therefore medicine partakes fiery quality nature life strengthen better expel disease settle seat scripture saith life body blood whoever try must anotomize fire manifest fiery spirit volatile salt spirit doubtless blood residence life least food wood fire observe better every norishment prepared fitter digestion raw flesh would agree stomack

spirit life pottage well sweetened sugar termed cordial yet void admittance society life corroborate swouning spirit commonly heterogeneal kind medicine best next could wished gold note said blood seat life application ought made life blood contains fiery spirit volatile salt food life fiery spirit volatile salt according principle experience hath taught whatsoever done worthy note effected either fiery spirit volatile salt ready joyn presently food life distemper get victory patient past cure created sublunary thing divided animal vegetable mineral find first yeelds fiery spirit volatile salt well urine flesh blood excellent fiery quality eminently medicinal vegetable find nothing effectual spirit well essential volatile salt especially alcaliis may disclosed extracted brought unto prerogative volatility mineral find sulphur mineral mettals separated fire crude malignant mercuriality harmless called tincture sulphurous tincture spirit salt partake fiery quality apt therefore joyn life fire distemper root body therefore let body henceforth ignorant say phisitian making use excellent medicine doth burn patient mean time others go feed fire life water rather quench totally object shall patient lie great burning heat shall put fire fire answ indeed thing hitherto deceived many physitians avoid hot thing call administred lie hot burning fit therefore remember said life caelestial fire light natural body without body cold dark dead take notice instance viz iron like put aquafortis though feeleth coldish yet presently grows hot boyls without fire much man bare hand cannot hold vessel contains burning heat seems unto man arise violent action aquafortish spirit upon iron eye may easily disern suppose thou wouldst quench hot burning fire pouring much cold water upon thing contrary fire though boyling may seem cease quenched yet effect prove consume iron one way well way however slowly insensibly water poured upon therefore put cold thing fire way quench wilt thou right give spirit eat devour salt thus shall lose strength broken leave boyling consuming appears salt cold thing yet able make peace betwixt hot thing viz aquafortis iron like manner burning heat rise sick body rise parallel action betwixt two thing working upon one another therefore make thy application cold thing immediately hot burning nothing material accidental quality symptome flowing action two fighting thing aforesaid upon body make thy application either two break strength presently heat cease may done hot thing called well may think cold one salia declared although center meer fire experience make true much application said burning quenched spirit life mightily strengthened also thereby enabled overpower enemy endeavour quarter stronghold body man filled every volatile salt nay little else volatile salt throughout save content stomach government whose fermental moisture acid parallel vinegar spirit sulphur like acid liquor acid liquor volatile salt enemy fighting together overpower one another hence perhaps something acid fall beyond said government stomach presently rise fight said acid volatile salt region blood said acid stranger falling pirate native countrey volatile salt whose dominion blood fight flow hot invisible vapour like unto radiant shining sun throughout body make physician believe distemper self mean root distemper hidden eye therefore go quench burning heat cold thing called weakeneth natural fire life expectation quenched said burning heat given strange pirate large compass waste insensibly garrison blood viz volatile salt deceived deceiveth patient also setpurpose perswaded otherwise therefore worthy compassion one take cochinele like meerly coagulated blood dissolveth water poureth aquafortis thereupon presently appear action betwixt said cochinele aquafortis may serve instance whereby eye man may discern demonstratively effect acid guest draweth blood thus somewhat answered vulgar objection might move enlarged intention bent purpose yet may suffice kindle fire although nothing else tinder spark london january alb faber
