totally object ſhall patient lie great burning heat ſhall put fire fire anſw indeed thing hitherto deceived many phyſitians avoid hot thing call adminiſtred ſuch lie hot burning fit therefore remember ſaid life caeleſtial fire light moſt natural body without body cold dark dead take notice inſtance viz iron like put aquafortis though feeleth coldiſh yet preſently grows hot boyls without fire ſo
