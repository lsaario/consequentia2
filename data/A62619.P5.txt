world author epistle hebrew last day say god hath spoken u son also made world brightness glory express image person purpose st paul colos speaking christ call image invisible god firstborn every creature born thing created evidently follow reason given next word calld firstborn every creature thing created heaven earth visible invisible thing created thing thing subsist whence plain firstborn every creature thus much least understood creature therefore cannot creature unless could nay apostle say expresly text called firstborn every creature whole creation thing created creature duration dignity must necessity thing made maker always thing made also better greater dignity yet must acknowledge seems small difficulty interpretation given expression christ said apostle firstborn every creature whole creation strictness speech firstborn nature respect said firstborn must creature well respect said firstborn objection full strength plausible appearance yet hope done satisfy one consider thing impartially without prejudice duly attend scope apostle reasoning text compare parallel place new testament neither apostle meaning affirming christ firstborn every creature insinuate son god creature possibly agree follows given reason christ said firstborn every creature namely thing made apostle word firstborn every creature whole creation thing created according socinian interpretation would reason contrary way thing created creature apostle meaning expression must either son god b saviour creature said presently thing reason added proper pertinent thing thing created sense probable son god elsewhere call beginning creation god rev meaning philosopher frequently use word nonlatin alphabet principle efficient cause creation find word translation render beginning used together word firstborn importance beginning firstborn dead col principle efficient cause resurrection dead else seems probable indeed true meaning expression title firstborn every creature apostle mean lord heir creation firstborn natural heir justinian tell u heir anciently signify lord therefore scripture us term promiscuously equivalentacts whereas st peter faith jesus christ lord st paul call heir thing rom reason given apostle call firstborn every creature fit proper thing created well may said lord heir creation made thing made without thing made made yet appear much evident consider apostle hebrew several ancient thought st paul give christ title st paul epistle colossian done calling image god maker world instead title firstborn every creature call heir thing add reason title god made world god say hath last day spoken unto u son hath constituted heir thing brightness glory express image person upholding thing word power c exactly parallel passage st paul colossian christ calld image invisible god likewise said made thing thing subsist apostle hebrew different word sense expresseth upholding thing word power powerful word thing first made instead calling firstborn every creature thing made call heir thing god also made world indeed expression firstborn every creature cannot admit sense agree well reason follows sense mentioned namely therefore heir lord whole creation creature made exactly answer word apostle hebrew hath constituted heir thing also made world apppeal sober considerate man whether interpretation given expression firstborn every creature much agreeable tenour scripture plain scope design apostle argument reasoning text insisted longer upon great text upon arians lay main strength stress opinion son god creature said apostle firstborn every creature expression meant heir lord whole creation shewd agreeable use word first born among hebrew likewise description given christ parallel text cited epistle hebrew expression first born every creature nothing purpose either arians socinian prove son god creature besides interpretation given make apostle sense much current easy text run thus image invisible god heir lord whole creation thing made four expression evangelist explaind four thing distinctly affirmed word first beginning already exist thing began created thing made consequently without beginning time never
