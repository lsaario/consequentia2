cause consequence cause growth 1642 1682 may said followeth viz 1642 1650 men came countrey london shelter outrage civil war time 1650 1660 royal party came london private inexpensive living 1660 1670 king friend party came receive favour happy restauration 1670 1680 frequency plot parliament might bring extraordinary number city reason assign like increase 1604 1642 know unless pick remarkable

1642 1682 put whole upon natural spontaneous benefit advantage men find living great small society shall therefore seek antecedent cause growth consequence like considered greater character proportion whereas arithmetick two false position truth extracted hope two extravagant contrary supposition draw forth solid consistent conclusion viz first said two supposition city london seven time bigger inhabitant four million 690 thousand people city port town village two million 710 thousand supposition city london seventh part present bigness inhabitant 96 thousand rest inhabitant 7 million 304 thousand cohabit thus 104 thousand small city town rest seven million 200 thousand inhabit house contiguous one another viz 1200 thousand house 24 acre ground belonging accounting 28 million acre
