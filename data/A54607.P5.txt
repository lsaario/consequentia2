two following table viz one whereof continuation eighteen year ending table published pag book observation upon london bill mortality printed year sheweth number people dyed medium two year indifferently taken twenty year distance first said two table dom parish parish one parish buried besides plague christened according latter table dyed followeth latter tie said two table dyed london medium year b c e wherein observe number c double double b within c double b within e double c within e double b c within c e double b c within e quadruple difference every way considered allow doubling people london forty year sufficient estimate thereof round number without trouble fraction also say near number people london burial multiplyed one dying yearly appears pag aforementioned observation maketh said number thousand tenanted house credibly informed make thousand soul said two account differing considerably thus pretty well sound number year viz city london hath doubled present number inhabitant thousand must also endeavour whole territory england wale order whereunto first saythe people london eleventh part england wale assessment london eleventh part whole territory therefore people whole may well eleven time london viz people england million thousand million thousand soul account pollmoney hearthmoney bishop late numbring communicant pretty well agree wherefore although said number million thousand cannot demonstrated truth yet serve good supposition much want present time people double yet hard found good experience said pag aforementioned observation countrey one fifty dye per annum late account sometimes birth burial two point universally constantly true would colour enough say people doubled year example suppose people let fiftieth part dye per annum shall dye per annum birth increase people shall somewhat half man per annum consequently supposed number cannot doubled year reckon round number aforementioned fraction exact rather call also good observation even countrey one per annum hath dyed five birth four burial according doctrine dye per annum born increase hundred twentieth part said two fair computation differing one ten also several good observation measure might insert although birth last computation twenty fourth part people yet natural possibility may near thrice many near late observation teeming female said male also every teeming woman bear child two year plain birth may abating sickness young abortion natural barrenness may remain birth eighth people observation found two thirtieth part quarter thus shewn naturally possible according reckoning birth may burial annual increase people said people may double year differs yet abovementioned get difficulty temper vast disagreement took medium dying per annum pitchd upon also took medium birth burial birth burial viz allowing birth burial upon supposition must dye per annum abovementioned birth must two third increase two third five third man number compared third time doubling year men give year time doubling including allowance war plague famine effect whereof though terrible time place happen yet period year great matter whole nation plague england year hath carried away scarce eightieth part people whole nation late year civil war like whereof hath several age take away fortieth part whole people according account measure doubling england wale million thousand people million thousand beginning queen elizabeth reign anno two million norman conquest consult doom day book lord hale origi ation mankind memorandum million world people double year present million computed learned men measure nation world degree peopled good account people several upon face earth within next year increase give one head every two acre land habitable part earth according prediction scripture must war great slaughter c wherefore expedient abovementioned difference year present countrey admit year time wherein people england double according present law practice marriage city double people year present number thousand whole territory million thousand double year aforesaid underwritten table appears anno people city whole country inconsiderably wherefore certain necessary growth city must stop said year utmost height next preceeding period anno number city eight time present number viz million thousand besides said number million thousand perform tillage pasturage rural work necessary done without said city following table viz annis burial people london people england former table nowthat london highest growth eight time great anno people london shall come near people england follows growth london must stop said year aforesaid must greatest height anno eight time four million service countrey port aforesaid aforementioned vast difference year year doubling peoplea digression use vast difference year doubling make use viz justifie scripture good history concerning number people ancient time supposing eight person came ark increased progressive doubling every year might grow first year flood year flood abouts noah dyed one million time million rational conjecture thought world hard compute intermediate year growth may made according set following table wherein making doubling year first within year last take discretionary liberty justifiable observation scripture rest table leave corrected historian know bigness ancient city army colony respective age world mean time affirming without difference measure period doubling extreams whereof demonstrated real true impossible solve

table shewing people might doubled several age world anno flood period doubling year person year year flood thousand million million million million moses time david time birth christ noted table assigned different number year time doubling people several age world might done several country world therefore said several period assigned whole world lump may well enough consist year especially assigned england day norman conquest said year may well enough serve supposition time world fully peopled lay stress upon one disquisition concerning growth city london spoken growth london measure period thereof come next cause consequence cause growth may said followeth viz men came countrey london shelter outrage civil war time royal party came london private inexpensive living king friend party came receive favour happy restauration frequency plot parliament might bring extraordinary number city reason assign like increase know unless pick remarkable accident happening part said period make cause increase vulgar people make cause every man sickness last eat wherefore rather say quidlibet de quolibet rather quit even abovesaid cause london increase put whole upon natural spontaneous benefit advantage men find living great small society shall therefore seek antecedent cause growth consequence like considered greater character proportion whereas arithmetick two false position truth extracted hope two extravagant contrary supposition draw forth solid consistent conclusion viz first said two supposition city london seven time bigger inhabitant four million thousand people city port town village two million thousand supposition city london seventh part present bigness inhabitant thousand rest inhabitant million thousand cohabit thus thousand small city town rest seven million thousand inhabit house contiguous one another viz thousand house acre ground belonging accounting million acre whole territory england wale adjacent island man plea may examine upon good map question two imaginary state would convenient commodious comfortable living general question divide self several question relating following particular viz defence kingdom foraign power preventing

difference either two state may hindred promoted either cause plague remembred one time another plague happeneth london year thereabouts last hundred year year five great plague viz anno also page duplicate page duplicate remembred plague london commonly kill one fifth part inhabitant whole people england double year annual increase year city london two million people year hence plague killing one fifth namely year destroy many one year whole nation refurnish consequently people nation shall never increase people london shall million first two extravagant supposition premised people whole nation shall lessen per annum people worth l per head hath elsewhere shewn said greatness city damage self whole nation hundred thousand pound per annum prorata greater lesser number wherefore determine two state best say towards said two state authority bend present state balance ought made disadvantage plague advantage accruing particular abovementioned unto balance exact account people
