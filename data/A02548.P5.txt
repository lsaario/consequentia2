quidam virgines sunt continentes quidam vero incontinentes quibus concidit nuptias ne tentet eos sathanas propter incontinentiam suam ruinam turpitudinis corruant sed sacerdotes quo que alij quidem continentes sunt alij vero incontinentes qui continentes sunt continentiae suae donum deo consecuti sunt sine eius dono gratia continentes esse non possunt incontinentes vero hoc donum gratiae minime percipiunt qui cum intemperantia suae conspersionis tum etiam animi infirmitate per carnis desideria diffluunt quod nullo modo facerent si continentiae gratiam virtutem deo percepissent sentiunt anim ipsi alia legem membris suis repugnantem legi mentis sua captinantem eos lege peccati et quod nolunt agere cogentem qui de corpore mortis huius liberantur gratia dei hac ita que eos lege captiuante carnis concupiscentia stimulante aut fornicari coguntur aut nubere quarum quid melius sit apostolica docemur authoritate qua dicitur melius nubere quam vri quod melius est id certe eligendum tenendum est melius est inquam nubere quia peius est vri quia melius est nubere quam vri conueniens est incontiuentibus vt nubant non vt vrantur bonae etenim sunt nuptia sicut augustinus ait libro super genesin ad litera ipsi commendatur bonum naturae quo incontinentiae regitur pranitas naturae decoratu foecunditas n vtriusque senus infirmitas propendens ruinam turpitudinis recte excipitur honastate nuptiarum vt quod sanis possit esse officium grotis remedium neque enim quia incontinentia malum est ideo connubium vel quo incontinentes copulantur non est bonum mo vero non propter illud malum culpabile est bonum sed propter hoc bonum veniale est illud malum quoniam id quod bonum habent nuptiae quod bonae sunt nuptiae peccatum esse nunquam potest hoc autem tripartitum est fides prole sacramentum fide attenditur ne praeter vinculum coniugale cum altera vel cum altero concubatur prole vt amanter suscipiatur benigne suscipiatur religiose educetur sacramento vt coniugium non separetur demissus aut demissa ne causa prolis alteri coniugatur haec est tanquam regula nuptiarum qua vel naturae decoratur foecunditas vel incontinentiae regitur prauitas hanc autem regulam nuptiarum hoc tripartitum bonum instituit aeterna veritas ordine decenti lege aeterna contra quam quicquid fit vel dicitur vel concupiscitur peccatum est quod libro contra faustum manichaeum augustinus testatur dicens peccatum est factum vel dictum vel concupitum contrae aeternam legem aeterna lex est diuina voluntas siue ratio ordinem naturalem perturbari vetans conseruari iubens quicquid igitur ordinem naturalem perturbari iubet conseruari vetat exercere nuptias earum tripartitum bonum fidem scilicet prolem sacramentum eos habere prohibet regulam illam aeternae veritatis qua naturae decoratur foecunditas vel incontinentiae regitur prauitas eos soluere praecipit c quibus naturalis ordo peragitur abhomi ari iubet hoc inquam mandatum naturalem ordinem conseruari vetat perturbari iubet ideo contra aeternam legem fit et peccatum est peccant enim qui mandatum tale instituunt quo naturalis ordo destruitur nam etiam vt videtur minime credunt quod de sacerdotum filijs assumat deus ad aedificandam supernam ciuitatem ad restaurandum angelorum numerum si enim crederent nunquam tale mandatum instituerent quia scienter nimia temeritate id efficere conaretur vt superna ciuitas nu quam proficiatur angelorum numerus nunquam reperaretur si enim superna ciuitas de filijs etiam sacerdotum perficienda est si angelorum numerus de ipsis etiam reperandus est qui hoc efficere conatur vt nulli sint quantum ipso est supernam ciuitatem destruit angelorum numerus ne perficiatur efficit quo quod peruersius potest fieri hoc enim fit contra voluntatem praedestinationem illius qui quae futura sint fecit fecit enim praedestinatione quae futura sunt opere quicunque ergo id efficere conatur non faciat deus opere quae fecit praedestinatione ipsam praedestinationem dei conatur euacuere si ergo deus fecit praedestinatione vt filij sacerdotum futuri sint opere qui hoc efficere conatur vt non futuri sint opere destruere molitur facta dei quod fecit praedestinatione ita praedestinationem dei nititur euertere voluntatem dei contraire quae aeterna est voluit enim deus ab aeterna ante saeculum omnes homines creare saeculo certo quidem ordine quo praecogitauit praedestinauit eos se creaturum nihil enim inordinate facit nihil saeculo creat quod non ante praedestinatione suae mentis procedente omnia saeculo disponendo praeordinauerit quaecunque ergo hoc saeculo ab ipso creantur praedestinationem mentis praedisponentem ac praeordinantem omni necessario sequuntur quod impossibile est non fieri quod deus ab aeterno voluit praeordinauit fieri necesse est igitur omnes homines eo ordine creari quo voluit ab aeterno praeordinauit alioquin non sicut voluit deus ne que sicut praeordinauit omnes homines sunt crea sed quod hoc inconueniens est necesse est illos creari sicut voluit ab aeterno praecogitauit que praeordinauit quod omnia quae voluit fecit nihil vnquam fecit quae non voluit ab aeterno praecogitauit decreto certo incommutabili quia nec eius voluntas irrite potest fieri nec praecogitatio falli nec praeordinationes commutari quae cum ita sint necesse est vt sicut laici ita etiam sacerdotes de quibus homines creantur ad ipsos creandos ministerium exhibeant diuinae voluntati praeordinationi parentes non sunt authores creationis filiorum sed ministri qui si ministerium non exhiberent voluntatem dei praecogitationem si possibile esset irritam facerent ordinationique resisterent quod si scienter facerent grauius vtique delinquerent si nescienter minus non solum deum patrem sed coelestem ierusalem sanctorum omnium matrem quod quantum ipsis esset illos creari non permitterens ex quibus ea aedificanda coelestis patriae dantia sunt praeparanda sed ab hoc delicto defendit eos potentia quod non possunt voluntati dei resistere praeordinationi contraire voluntas enim dei praedestinatio lex aeterna est qua omnium rerum cursus cretus est paradigma est quo omnium saeculorum forma depicta est quod nulla ratione aboleri potest huic igitur ministeriu non exhibere malu est quod exhibire bonum est maxime cum bona fit voluntate quod tum fit cum parentes conueniunt causa giguendae prolis non appetitu exercendae libidinis gignendae prolis dico quia praesens ecclesia multiplicatur coelestis ciuitas fabricetur electorum numerus compleatur quorum nihil potest fieri sine conuentione talus si enim primo parentes sanctorum omnes aut continentes permansissent aut virgines nullus sanctoru ex eis esset natus saeculo nullus gloria honore coronatus coelo nullus adscitu angelorum numero sed quia inestimabile bonum est quod sancti natisunt saeculo quod gloria honore coronantur coelo quod adsciti sunt angelorum numero ex eo parentum foecunditas beatior praedicatur conuentus sanctior sic ergo melius fuit eis tale filios genuisse quam non genuisse talem que fructum nuptiarum protulisse quam si e fructu continentes aut virgines extitisse quamuis bonum fit quibusdam continentes esse vel virgines illis viz quos deus v luit ab aeterno praeordinauit ita creandos esse saeculo vt continentia vel virginitate permaneant sicut enim voluit ab aeterno praeordinauit quosdam ita creandos esse saeculo vt fructu nuptiarum faciant filios generent ita etiam voluit praeordinauit ab aeterno quosdam ita creandos esse vt continentia vel virginitate permaneant et sicut illi ad creandos filios voluntati dei praeordinationi ministerium exhibent ita isti ad conseruandam continentiam virginitatem voluntati dei est praeordinationi ministrant ac per hoc illorum foecunditas istorum virginitas bona est que laudabilis quae si non ministeriu exhiberet voluntati dei et praeordinationi nec bona esset nec laudabilis omne enim quod voluntati dei praeordinationi contrarium est nec bonum est nec laudabile si ergo voluit deus praedestinauit alios futuros virgines ali nuptiarum fructum facientes si enim omnes essent virgines nullus sanctoru qui vel nascitur vel nasciturus sit hoc saeculo natus esset vel nasciturus nec ipsi etiam virgines essent quia nati non essent ex foecunditate enim illorum orta est istorum virginitas magnum igitur bonu est foecunditas de qua sanctum praecessit virginitas quia autem virgines esse debeant qui nuptiarum fructus facientes docet eos verbu quod deus seminat cordibus illorum aliorum enim cordibus se verbum bonae foecunditatis nuptiarum fructum facientis aliorum vero cordibus seminat verbum virginitatis deest opinor par clausulae illi ergo quibus seminat verbum virginitatis c ipsi virginitatem seruare desiderant quibus vero verbum nuptiarum seminat ipsi facere nuptiarum fructum
