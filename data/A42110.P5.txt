new experiment useful observation concerning seawater made fresh according patentee invention discourse humbly dedicated majesty king greatbritain c fellow colledge physician royalsociety printed anno dom king excellent majesty may please majesty making seawater fresh hath late bin much discoursd great consequence respect merchantships also conceive majesty navy garrison seaporttowns part world good water wanting proper said upon matter lie making good three assertion seawater may easily safely commodiously sufficient quantity made fresh common us sea ii done wholsom drunk usd dyet water use sea iii advantage much countervail charge trouble truth first reputation gentleman majesty patent interest also assure u instrument scarce yard may stand deck ship well cookroom smoak fire avoided make ninety gallon twenty four hour largest allowance three quart man kept constant working serve hundred twenty men although two quart day three pint time scarcity counted good allowance one man likewise assured may done ease ordinary attendance although sea salter place others yet operation neither difference betwixt come first last whatever put engine water may easily done salt oatemeal pottage one man may serve make drink us ship mr boyle also assured sea water thus made fresh wholesome drank water town best condition ingenious physician colledge proper comparison hath made betwixt
