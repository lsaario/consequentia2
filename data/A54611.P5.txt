upon several material thus enumerated several instance wherein duplicate subduplicate proportion great importance might fall downright upon application proportion respective matter mentioned custome hath made almost necessary make preface every discourse preface one lecture shall may serve many explication self least understand matter body figure place motion quantity quality habit time proportion weight swiftness force elasticity shall without imposing scarce recommending would glad man speaks matter importance word us often would first give dictionary word contein meaneth wherefore shall preface prefix dictionary wherein dare define matter en substance think men conceive matter better either two word en substance define word think consider conceive word soul spirit act like reason presuming understand conceive imagine fancy word matter thought well use venture say followeth first place image fancy matter matter considered quantity fancy place ratio several quantity considered together proportion several like rationes situation several place considered together figure quantity situation considered together body matter figure considered together motion change place time image motion quality several motion considered together habit motion repeated likeness several figure quality proportion considered together swiftness time place space considered together force body swiftness considered together right image possession place body elasticity shall speak hereafter next place suppose first matter world atom matter immutable magnitude figure suppose corpuscle many atom joyned together make visible sensible object iuncture atomes made innate motion moreover suppose every atom like earth globe magnet wherein three point considerable viz two surface called pole one within substance called center rather byas atom consider neither magnitude gravity atom also may motion copernicus attribute earth lastly motion point make streight line circle center several point circle angle say motion corpuscle compounded abovementioned motion atom motion bigger tangible body viz quality decompounded motion situation figure magnitude corpuscle premiss phaenomena nature must solved preface shall trouble said dictionary wherein find mean every material word intend use ensuing exercise thus begin viz first instance wherein duplicate subduplicate ratio proportion considerable velocity two equal like ship velocity say square root power either drive draw example two ship sail near double velocity square root unto like root sail near triple velocity shall root root quadruple sail requisite double swiftness noncuple treble sail must duplicate proportion swiftness ship subduplicate let two ship equal sail unlike unequal sharpness suppose head one extremely obtuse quite flat head isosceles triangle added thereunto say swiftness body shall root perpendicular triangle root half base half breadth secondly triangular head cyphered away angle bottom top root perpendicular root depth thickness velocity thirdly said head cyphered wayes together proportion velocity shall half one mentioned proportion added whole proportion ex gr suppose perpendicular trianglehead half breadth whole depth one proportion shall root root half proportion proportion root root add proportion sum fifthly suppose two paralellepipedons unequal head resistance ex gr suppose sail bigger lesser velocity bigger shall velocity lesser root root resistance sail bigger le proportionable resistance sail le whereas suppose wherefore velocity shall root almost root memorandum wetting sail lessening intersperst aperture threds sailcloth doth make sail bigger biggerness may known measured increase ship velocity upon wetting ship move one tenth part quicker wetting may conclude sail swollen equivalent part bigger whose root exceeds whose root way different velocity arising different trim ship may also computed best trim make least resistance caeteris paribus said thus much effect sharpness sail two principal cause velocity shipping unto others may referred shall add want two advantage chief cause short bluff undermasted vessel sail cheaper others suppose two ship equal burthen unlike dimension main beam one scarse keel length full th say first hull latter shall cost part former advantage sailing shall scarce part suppose sharper could carry much sail bluffer whereof advantage sailing would part sail mast yard must substance value much mast yard weight bulk cordage rigging must answerable mast yard sail rigging great windtaught ship correspond require proportionable cable weight anchor must follow size cable number hand must proportionable premiss one ship cost least double much sail double charge wage victual ware tare c trading ship one time another whole reign sail day suppose sharper largersaild ship sail dayes performs difference dayes part wage victual charge whereas charge supposed double say consideration great weight vessel burden especially carry gross cheap bulky commodity neither liable damage perishing good part seacarriage consist hand safety enemy speedy dispatch upon important occasion preoccupation market case sharpness great sail may admitted greatest proportion practicable thus digressed mind said velocity root resistance extent sail c may well askt know since seaman shipwright either writing discourse seem understand important position answer many observation calculation comparison found praeter propter true although many circumstance intermingle experiment disturb confound namely ill placing mast ill cutting standing sail ill trim vessel cleanness foulness sail le worn wet also taught slack rigging c wherefore onely avoid last mentioned intricacy also make position examinable every one desire say different velocity body several sharpness drawn driven different power knock falling weight self others much experimented large canales trough water fitted convenient apparatus purpose man judiciously right honorable lord brouncker president society think hard conceive weight sail power like effect reducible principle body moved double velocity drawn quadruple weight triple noncuple weight doubt hold sail impellent power proportion clearing easier trying hereof offer two small machinaments heretofore made society one measure velocity wind power equivalency weight whereby appear wind double velocity stir quadruple weight like case according proportion root square mentioned may also seen even good turnspitjack quadruple weight make double velocity distance time beginning motion time weight descent also revolution fly intermediate wheel perhaps reason phaenomena may expected answer many parallel instance hereafter mentioned like concurrent witness prove premiss least practical use giving reason take explaining subject first principle atomical matter motion leave discourse long exercise second instance strength timber c let square rod piece made clean timber material whose end let supported convenient block fulcrum rod experience bear weight hung middle according proportion length distance fulcrum say rod double length rod b bear weight b bear triple length bear one third sic de caeteris let two equal alike square rod placed one upon touch sit two together shall bear time much one alone three placed aforesaid shall bear nine time much proportion root square lay two rod side side shall bear double three shall bear triple forward arithmetical proportion whence follows four placed square shall bear eight time much one alone four rod taken one double length making octuple quantity one shall bear four time weight one alone two like piece timber cubical triplicate proportion side strong according duplicate proportion square respective side consequently like vessel differing content cube like side equally strong timber consist must quadratoquadratic say ship tun equally strong one must time much timber time seldom never done defect true reason great shipping dearer weaker small shipping ship world strong nutshel say weaker said dearer shall said hereafter sixteenth instance mast diamond c hand timber quadratoquadratic ship tun would loaden material ship tun overtimbered well understanding matter many men designing engine strength make model machinaments scale suppose wherein inch represents foot model part engine intended thereupon conceive model strong enough bear part great machinament intended bear said great machinament strong enough whereas indeed model must bear full intended great machinament otherwise great mischief appear work wherefore square linear difference model engin measure way trying strength sufficiency sought ignorance whereof hath made many poor projector upon principle cask hold tun ought time much timber cask hold onely barrel tun provided one strong usually seen bigger vessel cart c usually weaker compard strength lesser appears also animal whose strength square root weight substance viz mouse equiponderate one horse said horse part strong said mouse consideration scantling timber building must adjusted example let wall room infinitely sufficiently strong let length breadth room given next suppose room made strong every foot half square shall bear man square foot bear tun weight reckoning men tun lastly let strength timber also given question find scantling girder gise c first square piece afterwards altering square advantageous ablong size example let room supposed foot long broad viz foot area able receive men bear tun suppose timber whereof rod inch square foot long bear part hundred weight rod board inch broad foot long within wall whole hundred weight whole floor consisting board board planck inch thick would bear time hundred weight inch hundred weight whole weight designed hundred size inch thick suffice case suppose floor planck without gise girder next suppose instead planck used gise double thickness said planck placed quadruple distance say effect strength half stuff also say one girder alone inch square foot long near equivalent gi inch deep broadabovementioned girder half stuff gise gise contein half stuff inchplanck first mentioned contein saving stuff reason dividing plank girder gise board note proportion scantling offered exact best practice onely intimate method inquiring matter useful world third instance oar boat c determine make good estimate power oar first easier calculation suppose paralellipipedonboat vessel breadth fit pair skull viz foot broad length sufficient skull oar viz foot long one foot deep draw three inch water next suppose every skuller skull bench c weight equivalent three cubical foot water every pair skull appurtenance depresses sink vessel foot inch suppose also smooth calm standing water one rower row vessel foot two mile hour second say one remex skuller move quarter inch draught foot forward second like rower shall move vessel drawing quarter inch water foot second plus second second shall row vessel root root near time one rower alone could done suppose oar lengthened two three many stroaks made time velocity shall increase proportionably suppose oar remain length blade doubled velocity shall increase according root doubling c supposing still number stroaks within time every case experiment suppose experiment made still water water run foot hour stream velocity lessened one half accelerated answerably lastly said water rough vessel heavs set suppose degree quadrant asmuch boat way encreased much tangent degree exceeds radius way velocity boat must abate proportionably fourth instance motion horse suppose horse travel mile hour pound burthen back half said burthen shall travel double three mile half suppose horse pound burthen endure travel hour per diem half burthen may endure hour double hour lastly suppose horse racehorse run rate four mile hour mile per hour run mile rate mile per hour one half hour run mile rate mile per hour whole hour run mile hour run mile mile per hour hour run mile mile per hour hour mile per hour hour may go mile mile hour agrees well enough experience fifth instance mill wind blow suppose sawmill double velocity sawmill carried one saw shall carry four treble shall carry nine like true water gushing upon float undershot mill may seen stamper papermills stock fullingmills work like nature sixth instance gunpowder way bullet shot good gun square root quantity gunpowder fired say powder fired go unburnt go rather shot powder length gun signifies constraining powder within line direction till fired use hard ramming screwing gun also excellency powder fire quick go gun say therefore velocity caused gunpowder root powder fired say pound powder equally fired within piece shall carry bullet twice far one pound shall time last mentioned number root double distance aforementioned capacity concave gun ought weight bullet powder length one gun hath well found good experimentation may also known length every gun every bullet respectively example suppose gun carry ball inch diameter foot long concave content said concave cylindrical inch question long must piece carry bullet inch diameter say forasmuch weight inch bullet concave greater gun must proportion viz like inch may contein fire proportionable quantity powder divided area bullet quotient inch foot speak shortly plainly length gun must measured diameter respective bullet cannot say tried effect gunpowder abovementiond proportion credibly heard similitude sail weight knock point described unto gunpowder believe recommend thought experience seventh instance sound let many equal sound say distance may heard root number sound four musquets heard twice far one nine thrice rest reckoning hearing fleet engagement dutch even iamess park near city easily solved truth observation doth reciprocally countenance doctrine suppose fleet consisting two hundred ship great small piece ordnance board medium suppose demiculverins suppose also demiculverin circumstance wind air may easily heard five mile said engagement heard mile say said gun firing together near time might well heard mile gun might well heard mile one demiculverin five mile last point add prevent unbelief probable matter shall happen effect pope presage battel lepanto know eighth instance smell say smell viz distance perceived root quantity matter emitted doctrin apply solve hardly believe viz ship coming america towards portugal smell rosemary odoriferous herb mile land seems credible likely foot square rosemaryfield may smelt one perch rod whereof

falling body particularly water pump riverstreams let observed transparent pipe forcing pump many stroaks water forced bottom top let many mark made several place unto water mounted every stroak stroaks suppose equal time appear said division according proportion logarithm abovementioned descent acceleration falling body time root space fall said time respectively great effect whereof see overshotmills little water falling upon wheel large diameter produceth wonderful effect may well computed upon principle hold forth water also greater force abovementioned proportion hole place whereat issue lower surface may seen breast undershotmills pleasant divide sinking water equal space count clack revolution stroaks made within time water sinking every equal space therein abovementioned logarithmes may also observed unto head may referred leakage ship let hole ship somewhere water let seen water come said hole within space time let like hole made double perpendicular distance top water shall come four time much upper hole let third three distance shall admit time much c let two equal hole leak ship one head stern let ship motion leakage head composed pressure water surface ship motion together moreover ship make double way leakage quadruple treble way non cuple c wherefore stop leak afore ship must stop motion lye bear go wind sea c lastly shall add swiftness water riverstreams root power cause cause steepness descent sharper angle perpendicular wherefore knowing observation degree steepness causeth degree swiftness hereby doctrin height ground river riseth fall sea may computed fifteenth instance blast bellow ironwork furnace greatest regular moving bellow used commonly turned evenest overshot wheel time wherein bellow rise fall root strength bellowsblast upon fire rising double quickness admits double air time like manner squeezed double quickness make double expulsion consequently double swiftness whole passing twirepipe half time double swiftness make quadruple effect upon fire furnace aforesaid sixteenth instance price several commodity suppose mast small ship inch diameter usual foot heighth worth mast inch double length also shall onely cost eight time much according octuple quantity timber conteins shall cost time much l rule mast inch shall cost time l l last case instance whereas may objected mast four time foot long still say rule hold common practice dealing mast inch thick foot long worth mast inch throughout foot long shall worth l mast inch thorough foot long foot shall worth near l moreover suppose diamond pearl equal like figure water colour evenness differ onely weight magnitude say weight root price case aforegoing diamond decuple weight centuple value may said lookingglassplates might add loadstone take time loadstone b may also centuple value lastly tun extreme large timber may worth two tun ordinary dimension cause dearness great shipping small hull vessel tun may worth l per tun whereas hull vessel tun may worth near l per tun whence arises rule ship burthen know worth tun number size ordnance c seventeenth instance milldam seabancks bulwark fortress suppose wall dam banck sufficient keep resist sea stream appulse water certain force say make wall damm strong enough double swiftness appulse must augmented quadruple thickness must made sufficient greatest violence ever observed violence known root number wall thickness must augmented cannonbullets execution batter duplicata ratione swiftness therefore ramperts must strong thick duplicata ratione said swiftness depends upon distance battery degree tardation bullet make every part way gun rampert batter note bullet commonly beat cone wall whose vertex bullet entry like conical fovea seen sand hourglass eighteenth instance compression yielding elastic body wooll c suppose cylindrical parallelld sided vessel filld wool feather elastic material let covered moveable head pressing pilchard call buckler first observe low buckler descendeth weight upon head buckler lay triple weight make whole quadruple appear buckler sink much lower noncuple another like space lower several space depression root depressing power hence may seen force must increased every turn thred screwpress done according proportion understood doubt light substance convenient apparatus might compressed unto density weight even gold silver might condensd made question till heard anomaly practice must better consider truth whereof doth appear vnderwaterair within vessel waterdivers lower go find stock air shrink according root quantity superincumbent water weight like manner take bow hang weight middle string observe low draweth said string shall quadruple weight draw double first distance noncuple draw treble c drawn bow let arrow divided quotcunque partes equal part tension carrieth arrow equal distance notwithstanding equal part tension made unequal power equal space part also arrow first flight requires unequal force viz least strength first last proportion first mentioned fuze watch greatest strength spring made work upon shortest vectis least upon longest equalize whole like also happens traction muscle upon two bone turning joynt bone muscle make triangle whereof muscle base subtending anglejoynt working muscle strongest vectis smallest lying obliquely vice versa muscle moving bone come make right angle appendix elasticity done consideration duplicate subduplicate proportion elastic body material hope amiss subjoyn short appendix elasticity self whereby draw forth better thought men countenance correction wherefore say followeth viz first supposing every body figure positure may disturbed external force say elasticity power recovering figure upon removal force think easiest consider elastic springing resilient body lamina lath line streight lath force bent circularly doth upon removal force return streight elasticity circular hoop forced streight leap back crookedness elasticity elastic body return overshoot natural positure vibrate ci citra point seek doth pendulum magneticneedle till length rest one perpendicular meridian elastic body gross tangible body made corpuscle smallest body possibly seen corpuscle made atom smallest body nature whereof million doth perhaps make one corpuscle last mentioned know reason may upon occasion suppose atom several figure magnitude provided suppose immutable corpuscle gross tangible body mutable various addition detrition befal suppose every atome three point see know globe earth every magnet viz two pole superficies central point within substance call byas heaven also visibly pole must center gravity magnitude central predominant point suppose every atome may move axis atom also moon earth venus mercury sun
