ill cutting standing sail ill trim vessel cleanness foulness sail le worn wet also taught slack rigging c wherefore onely avoid last mentioned intricacy also make position examinable every one desire say different velocity body several sharpness drawn driven different power knock falling weight self others much experimented large canales trough water fitted convenient apparatus purpose man judiciously right honorable lord brouncker president society think hard conceive weight sail power like effect reducible principle body moved double velocity drawn quadruple weight triple noncuple weight doubt hold sail impellent power proportion clearing easier trying hereof offer two small machinaments heretofore made society one measure velocity wind power equivalency weight whereby appear wind double velocity stir quadruple weight like case according proportion root square mentioned may also seen even good turnspitjack quadruple weight make double velocity distance time beginning motion time weight descent also revolution fly intermediate wheel perhaps reason phaenomena may expected answer many parallel instance hereafter mentioned like concurrent witness prove premiss least practical use giving reason take explaining subject first principle atomical matter motion leave discourse long exercise second instance strength timber c let square rod piece made clean timber material whose end let supported convenient block fulcrum rod experience bear weight hung middle according proportion length distance fulcrum say rod double length rod b bear ½ weight b bear triple length bear one third sic de caeteris let two equal alike square rod placed one upon touch sit two together shall bear 4 time much one alone three placed aforesaid shall bear nine time much proportion root square lay two rod side side shall bear double three shall bear triple forward arithmetical proportion whence follows four placed square shall bear eight time much one alone four rod taken one double length making octuple quantity one shall bear four time weight one alone two like piece timber cubical triplicate proportion side strong according duplicate proportion square respective side consequently like vessel differing content cube like side equally strong timber consist must quadratoquadratic say ship 400 tun equally strong one 50 must 8 time much timber 16 time seldom never done defect true reason great shipping dearer weaker small shipping ship world strong nutshel say weaker said dearer shall said hereafter sixteenth instance mast diamond c hand timber quadratoquadratic ship 400 tun would loaden material ship 50 tun overtimbered well understanding matter many men designing engine strength make model machinaments scale suppose wherein inch represents foot model 11728 part engine intended thereupon conceive model strong enough bear 11728 part great machinament intended bear said great machinament strong enough whereas indeed model must bear full 1144 intended great machinament otherwise great mischief appear work wherefore square linear difference model engin measure way trying strength sufficiency sought ignorance whereof hath made many poor projector upon principle cask hold tun ought 16 time much timber cask hold onely barrel ⅛ tun provided one strong usually seen bigger vessel cart c usually weaker compard strength lesser appears also animal whose strength square root weight substance viz 1728 mouse equiponderate one horse said horse 1144 part strong said mouse consideration scantling timber building must adjusted example let wall room infinitely sufficiently strong let length breadth room given next suppose room made strong every foot half square shall bear man 31½ square foot bear tun weight reckoning 14 men tun lastly let strength timber also given question find scantling girder gise c first square piece afterwards altering square advantageous ablong size example let room supposed 26 foot long 20 broad viz 520 foot area able receive 250 men bear 16 tun suppose timber whereof rod inch square 20 foot long bear 120 part hundred weight 20 rod board 20 inch broad 20 foot long within wall whole hundred weight whole floor consisting 16 board 1600 board planck 4 inch thick would bear 16 time 1600 256 hundred weight 5 inch 400 hundred weight whole weight designed 325 hundred size 4 5 inch thick suffice case suppose floor planck without gise girder next suppose instead planck used gise double thickness said planck placed quadruple distance say effect strength half stuff also say one girder alone 18 inch square 20 foot long near equivalent 17 gi 9 inch deep 4½ broadabovementioned girder half stuff gise gise contein half stuff 4½ inchplanck first mentioned contein saving stuff reason dividing plank girder gise board note proportion scantling offered exact best practice onely intimate method inquiring matter useful world third instance▪ oar boat c determine make good estimate power oar first easier calculation suppose paralellipipedonboat vessel breadth fit pair skull viz 5 foot broad length sufficient 9 skull oar viz 30 foot long one foot deep draw three inch water next suppose every skuller skull bench c weight equivalent three cubical foot water every pair skull appurtenance depresses sink vessel 150 foot ¼ inch suppose also smooth calm standing water one rower row vessel 12000 foot two mile hour 3600 second say one remex skuller move 12 quarter 3 inch draught 12000 foot forward 3600 second 4 like rower shall move vessel drawing 15 quarter 3¾ inch water 12000 foot 1800 second plus 360 second 2160 second 9 shall row vessel root 21 root 208 near 3 7 37 time one rower alone could done suppose oar lengthened two three many stroaks made time velocity shall increase proportionably suppose oar remain length blade doubled velocity shall increase according root doubling 10 7 7 5 c supposing still number stroaks within time every case experiment suppose experiment made still water water run 6000 foot hour stream velocity lessened one half accelerated answerably lastly said water rough vessel heavs set suppose 20 degree quadrant asmuch boat way encreased much tangent 20 degree exceeds radius way velocity boat must abate proportionably fourth instance motion horse suppose horse travel 5 mile hour 200 pound burthen back half said burthen shall travel 7 double three mile half
