answer three paper mr hob lately published month august present september former part first paper reason proposition dr wallis prop cap de motu purpose doth repeat verbatim supposed row quantity infinitely many increasing according natural order number c square c cube c whereof last given row many equal l st first case second case third c affirmed svppose follow consequence mr hob doth deny therefore saith cavelling mr hob move question proposeth royal society requiring skil geometry logick latin resolve whether understood rather said supposed infinite row quantity whereof last given whether finite quantity divided infinite number lesser quantity finite quantity consist infinite number part whether quantity greater infinite whether finite magnitude center gravity whether number infinite whether arithmetick infinite use confirming confuting doctrine answer general say whether thing yea whether cannot proposition concerned affirms nothing either way whether supposed made supposition conditional proposition say mr hob mathematician would argue otherwise affirm either ever say upon supposition would doth many quaeres nothing proposition hath one word concerning gravity center gravity greater infinite usually euclide infinite meant assignable finite though absolutely infinite greatest possible mean infinite proposed actually possible performed supposed usual upon supposition thing impossible infer useful truth euclide second postulate requiring producing streight line infinitely either way mean actually performed possible man produce streight line infinitely supposed ab supposed produced though one way length must supposed become infinite finite length assignable finite finite production would serve produced way yet greater greater infinite greater necessary make finite length assignable whoever doth thus suppose infinite must consequently suppose one infinite greater another euclides tenth proposition ab may bisected half onwards infinitely meaning continual section proposed actually done supposed upon supp section infinitely continued part must supposed infinit ly many finite number part would suffice infinite section ab divided supposed side triangle abc point division supposed line c parallel bc parallel reckoning downward bc must consequently supposed infinitely many arithmetical progression c exceeding antecedent much exceeds next whereof last bc given supposition infinite attendant new peculiar cavallerius dr wallis euclide admits mathematician least supposable whether possible particular therefore quaeres answer may supposed row quantiti infinitely many continually increasing supposed parallel triangle abc reckoning downwards bc whereof last bc given finite quantity ab may supposed continual bisection divisible number part infinitely many finite number assignable stint beyond division may supposed continued still last small soever two half part undivided whole else supposed infinite one may supposed greater another supposed infinite number men may supposed greater number eye surface solid may supposed constituted infinitely long finitely great breadth continually decreasing greater proportion length increaseth center gravity toricellios solidum hyperbolicum acutum others innumerable discovered dr wallis monsieur format others determine requires geometry logick whatever latin tongue mr hob master may supposed number infinite greater assignable finite supposed number part arising supposed section infinitely continued therefore reason account doctrin euclide cavallerius dr wallis rejected use solved quaeres mr hob answer easily dispatched though supposed infinite serve mathematician well enough yet howsoever please prevaricate saith exercise mr hob concerned solve quaeres let ask therefore still opinion argument nature prove world beginning whether case must passed infinite number year mr hob born finite many soever must begun many year whether passed infinite number whether infinite infinite number year greater number day hour hitherto last given whether absurdity contrary mr hob would perswade u argument nature prove world beginning beholden mr hob argument argument use mr hob born serve mathematician supposed infinite infinite infinite year day hour already past must real infinite actually existed whereof last given yet follow mr hob shall well exercise solve propose quaeres infinite latter part first paper give u roset prop attempt squaring circle suppose dt dc dr mean proportional dc dt semidiameter dc equal quadrantal arc r dr tv thing false already shewed latin confutation rosetum published philosophical transaction july last past english demonstration peccant word col lin therefore arc tv arc r arc ca cannot continual proportion follows ground consequence thing manifest since construction dcca arc ca extended continual proportion semidiameter quadrantal arc drrs arc r extended continual proportion semidiameter quadrantal arc

proportional long dt dr dc continual proportion whether assigned continual proportion dt dr dc taken dt dr dc continual proportion greater le equal arc tu r ca extended continual proportion common fault mr hob demonstration demonstration ood would serve well proportion brings instead said else pleased demonstration good without chan ing one syllable equally prove proport semidiameter quadrantal arc yu please second paper pretend confute theorem hath long time passed truth therefore doth con ern dr wallis men ti four side f square divided number equal part ex mple streight line drawn opposite oints divide square lesser square received opinion saith dr wallis commonly seth root namely side whole square confute tell u root number square whereof whole contains therefore root square square de square side square super cies line answer say ti neither opinion doctor wallis know far received opinion master hob insinuates root square surely bare number cannot side square figure yet master hob would square root square length root square ti true number root number square square root square squared square like dousen root dousen dousen dousen square dousen must multiply dousen dousen square dousen make length length make square obtain square length therefore square length root side say root soldier soldier answer matter soldier product soldier soldier soldier number therefore neither soldier root length number make square length length length make length square proportion number length square side number square plain twice two two row two row number length side number square plain time square time proportion one doubt may believe eye mr hob might taught next carpenter know measure foot board could told side square foot inch length plain time inch square row row third paper came answer two former going press contains substance second latter part first need farther answer cannot take notice usual trade contradicting second paper say side square superficies line third say quite contrary prop square root speaking quantity line rectangle fault falsity contradiction great many omit gross need answer thought fit say mr hob three paper rather satisfie importunity others thought worth answering submit whole respect royal society mr hob make appeal
