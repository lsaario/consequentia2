false collection mr marshall l c j ti strange inference make think every witness perjured jury dont find according say perjured may swear true jury believe marshall ground lord upon lord jones said jury sate upon coleman going told either find guilty bring two men perjured thus opinion finding jury contrary evidence make perjured none court oppose mr jones marshall sense whole court man must either found guilty witness perjured case believed l c j see unconsequently talk court might say must believe men perjured swear positive thing find make use thus therefore perjured ti false till convicted upon record though jury believe yet may swear true marshall ti true l c j make inference marshall lord court tryed selfsame judge know upon tryal believed therefore perjured mr pemberton must consider sometimes jury go direction court witness believed argue swear truth perjured tell brother jones might say must find man guilty think men perjured many time judge say jury often find

humbly desire jury take notice self witness brought positive testimony last time jury believed must necessity brought guilty would spend time court would observe sworn positively consent king death thing l c j better luck marshall believed l c j purpose neither suffered break contrary law practice suffer argument evidence believed one case therefore perjured jury gave verdict contrary witness

modest court admit go throw dirt upon king witness men good reputation men shewed honest spoke truth along nere one testimony confirmed anothers one stand single say ill men marshall lord say ill men
