alphabet wind therefore consequence hold good apostle saith one spirit spirit must grammatical sense wind material thing spirit god even baptism must material outward baptism thus may see whether blind way drawing consequence doth lead even greatest impertinencies imaginable sixth argument mark hath defect seeing word baptised cannot meant conversion metaphorical baptism must therefore meant waterbaptism cannot meant conversion order word requireth faith go baptism whereas faith cannot go conversion faith conversion self say argument hath defect confounds part whole granting faith conversion part degree doth follow therefore whole furthest degree conversion work conversion sanctification hath several degree high eminent degree soul purification may called bap ism plunging

inward circumcision spirit antitype thing signified outward circumcision lastly seventh argument whereas laboureth prove waterbaptism meant matth whereof confident entreats reader believe henceforth prove shall briefly take proof consideration say greek word translated teach signifies make disciple therefore made disciple baptized could made disciple conversion conversion prerequire discipleship else man might endeavour conversion heathen man hand disciple answer granting greek word may signifie make disciple yet reasoning doth inferr baptizing cannot meant spiritual baptizing effusion spiritual water upon already said signifies barely first lowest degree conversion high eminent degree thereof even outward plunging dipping water small sprinkling true faith eminent degree conversion purification also true discipleship doth follow else man might endeavour conversion heathen endeavour full perfect conversion heathen highest degree possible god way order wit first teaching discipling true faith full perfect conversion purification spiritual cleansing follow one degree another reason baptism conversion spiritual cleansing soul improper metaphorical must throw word text scripture proper improper meaning without necessity constrain u answer first ought go proper signification word improper without urgent necessity already acknowledge doth brother frequently transgress

secondly doth barely take granted without shadow proof improper meaning mean baptism christ spiritual baptism proper meaning place sentence scripture certainly meaning spirit god doth intend whether metaphor used place doth metaphorical use word hinder meaning properwhen intended seeing scripture doth almost every whereabound metaphor metaphorical expression much consider bare grammatical sense word common speech common usual sense scripture common sense scripture judge proper meaning whether word otherwise metaphorical deny according scripture sense word christ properly understood true christ god wit begotten son yet grammatically metaphorical least much word baptize christ signifieth anointed even baptized signifieth ed dipped contend christ properly called christ anointed spiritual anointing real proper kind outward natural kind shall contend rather go along therein say also spiritual baptism real proper kind spiritual anointing kind thus also christ called bread scripture scripture sense truly properly called yea doth call true bread said manna moses gave people wilderness true bread heaven doth signifie whatever vertue excellency outward bread hath feed body christ inward spiritual bread hath much feed soul yea body also pleaseth respect affirm name bread water light oyl lik properly applyed spiritual natural water oyl light bread outward natural rather metaphorically called inward spiritual truly properly dese ving name thus spiritual baptism shall proper sense also let scripture searched shall find word baptize doth le commonly signifie spiritual
