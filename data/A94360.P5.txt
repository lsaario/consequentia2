done sacrifice slain make atonement sinner though reason hope effect blood bull goat living creature wont offered sacrifice yet jew heathen expect hope evident cannot without extreme ignorance obstinacy denyd expectation unreasonable soever plainly shews common apprehension mankind age god would appeased sin pardoned without suffering yet men generally conceived good hope upon repentance sinner god would accept vicarious punishment suffering stead probably said compliance apprehension mankind condescention well weighty reason best known divine wisdom god pleased find sacrifice really

equitable grateful construction forgive freely obj thirdly yet objected seems unreasonable sacrificing beast among jew nay sacrificing men among heathen even son daughter offering son god innocent excellent person ever answer consider manner design thing appear quite otherwise manner god command son sacrificed providence permitted wickedness violence men put death goodness wisdom overrule worst action best end consider matter aright reflection upon holy providence god enormity cuelties permission daily committed world consider end design permission christ death application purpose general expiation cannot acknowledge even adore gracious mercifull design mean god put end unreasonable bloody way worship long practiced world one sacrifice infinitely dear god benefit expiation expected way sacrifice worthless vain comparison hath ever since obtained effect making sacrifice cease part world christianity hath prevailed obj fourthly last objection injustice cruelty innocent person
