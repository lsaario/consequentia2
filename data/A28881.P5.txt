fermented heat blood decreaseth vessel evident circulation stoped presently decline whereas caused vessel would continue death well since hath matter though want circulation forcible mixture shewed consequence shall bring one argument prove theanother argument prove heat blood depends caused attrition heat blood depends upon attrition fermentation glandules may inferrd common observation heat blood encreased violent motion upon violent motion larger quantity animal spirit sent part moved order prepare greater quantity subtile liquor distend dilate fibre fermentation raised higher glandules motion heart thus accidentally increased quickens circulation blood much vigorous motion part raised precedent fermentation spent renued circulation blood quickened contraction heart also frequently

mixture fermentation animal spirit arterial blood hence manifest far circulation beneficialfermentation circulation mutually depend one another carrying heat blood consider reason given muscular motion shall see fermentation depends muscular motion muscular motion depends fermentation said continual chain circulation cause well humor man body proceed therefore second objection supposed second
