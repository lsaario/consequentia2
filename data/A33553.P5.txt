dammage debtor creditor resolve question multiply payment time viz l multiplyed month produceth l multiplyed moneths produceth l multiplyed month produceth sum product divide sum product total debt quotient month time paying whole debt quest merchant hath owing l paid followeth viz l month l month rest l month agreeth debtor make one payment whole demand time payment without dammage debtor creditor l multiplyed month l multiplyed month l multiplyed month sum product sum product divided whole debt l quote mon time payment whole debt truth rule thus manifest interest money paid equated time due proof rule equation payment equal interest money equated time paid much sooner due rate per c operation true otherwise example last question l paid month discharged till month month due wherefore interest month per c per annum l l paid month equated time payment therefore interest reckoned l paid mon paid month month sooner ought wherefore interest l month l accompting l per cent per annum equal interest l month wherefore work right quest merchant hath owing certain sum discharged equal payment viz two month four mon mon question equated time payment whole debt question nature viz debt divided equal unequal part part multiplyed time sum product answer multiplyed mon produceth multiplyed moneths produceth multiplyed month produceth sum product month equated time payment instead fraction representing part wrought number represented part according first second example would answer suppose debt l l payment viz month l multiplyed mon produceth l multiplyed mon produceth l multiplyed mon produceth sum product divided whole debt quoteth month quest merchant oweth sum money paid month moneths moneths agreeth creditor make one total payment demand time without damage debtor creditor work last question find answer moneths quest indebted b whereof pay present money moneths rest viz l moneths agree make equated time whole payment demand time question nature viz ready money paid multiplying neglect money paid present work rest directed divide sum product whole debt quote answer l paid present hath time allowed according rule multiplied time therefore time neither augmenteth diminisheth dividend wherefore proceed according direction say moneths produceth moneths produceth sum product divided whole debt quote moneths time payment quest indebted b certain sum whereof paid present money moneths rest moneths demand equated time payment answer moneths time payment quest indebted b l whereof paid moneths moneths rest moneths equated time payment whole sum answer moneths quest indebted b l due end moneths willing pay l present provi ded remainder forborn much longer make satisfaction fo kindness agreed upon desire know time ought alotted payment l remaining resolve question first find ou interest l time paid due per cent rate viz moneths find l evident remaining l must detained much longer moneths may eat interest viz l thus found viz first see interest l moneth time take one moneth interest one moneth rule three say moneth moneths l remaining must kept moneths beyond first time payment viz moneths added thereto make moneths end time ought make payment remainder chap xxx exchange rule exchange informeth merchant exchange money weight measure one countrey money weight measure another countrey rate reason proportion betwixt money weight

weight measure required find many piece last coyn weight measure equal value given number first sort coyn weight measure example first case may viz quest penny london equal ducat naples ducat naples make shilling brussels many penny london equal shilling brussels facit question may resolved two single rule three first say ducat naples make penny london many penny ducat make answ penny foregoing proportion discovered ducat naples make penny london tenour question see ducat venice make shilling brussels therefore penny london equal shilling brussels thing equal one thing also equal one another wherefore way laid open give solution question another single rule three whose proportion shilling brussels penny london shilling brussels penny london answer question example second case may viz quest l averdupoize weight london equal l weight amsterdam l amsterdam make l dantzick many pound dantzick equal l averdupois weight london answer pound dantzick question likewise answered two single rule three viz first say l amsterdam l lond l amsterdam l lond question find l amsterdam l dantzick therefore l london likewise equal thereunto wherefore say l london l dant l london dant find l dantzick equal l averdupois weight london speedy way resolve question contained two case mentioned laid mr kersey third chapter appendix mr wingates arithmetick hath given two rule resolution question pertinent two said case shall lay general rule solution case first let learner observe following direction placing given term viz let made two collumes collumes place given term one collume may found two term kind one thus placed term general rule observe said collumes hath term placed multiply term therein continually place last product dividend multiply term collume continually let last product divisor divide said dividend said divisor quotient thence arising answer question example first said case repeated viz penny london make ducat naples ducat naples make shill brussels many penny london equal shilling brussels term placed according rule stand followeth b penny lond duc na ducat na shill bruss shi l bruss thus placed term neither collume term one kind observe collume hath term therefore must multiplyed together dividend viz mult produceth multiplyed produc dividend collume b multiplyed together produceth divisor divided quotient penny answer let example second case repeated viz l averdupois weight london make l weight amsterdam l amsterdam make l dantzick many pound dantzick equal l averdupois weight london term disposed according rule foregoing stand thus b l lond l amsterdam l amst l dantzick l london whereby find term b multiplyed together produce dividend term viz produce divisor division finished quotient giveth pound dantzick answer chap xxxi single position negative arithmetick called rule false find truth number invented supposed either single double rule single position viz one false position feigned number find true number sought single rule false made choice position work according tenour question true number sought ordering position find result either much little may find number sought proportion following viz result position position given number number sought example quest person certain number crown said fourth third sixth added together would make demand number crown answer crown resolve question suppose crown number admit like division fourth third sixth four part viz added together make wherefore say rule three sum part position given number true number sought fourth third sixth added together make quest three person viz b c thus discourse together concerning age quoth b old half old quoth c b twice old quoth sure sum age demand man age answer b c year age added together make chap xxxii double position rule double position false position assumed give resolution question propounded vvhen question stated double position make crosse followeth math make choice number think may convenient working call first position place end crosse work position true number sought according nature question found errour either much little place side crosse make choice another number denomination first position call second position place side crosse b work position former found error either much little place side crosse c position stand top crosse error bottom correspondent position multiply error position crosswise say multiply first position second error second position first error put product position proceeded far consider whether error alike whether much little alike subtract lesser product greater set remainder dividend subtract lesser error greater let remainder divisor quotient arising division answer question error unlike one much little add product position error together sum shall dividend add error together sum shall divisor quotient arising hence answer two last rule may kept memory verse following viz error unlike kind addition doth ensue alike subtraction find dividing work quest b c build house cost l paid certain sum unknown b paid much l c paid much b desire know man share charge made cross according rule come according third rule make choice first position suppose paid l put upon cross see b paid l said paid l c paid l ti said paid much b add part math amount said paid l wherefore little note bottom cross position first error secondly suppose paid l b paid l c l added together make make wherefore error position put bottom cross position second error multiply error position crosswise viz error first position second position product multiply error second position first position product according rule subtract lesser product greater viz error alike viz little remaineth dividend subtract lesser error greater error remainder divisor divide quotient answer share payment secondly error bigg effect appeareth following work first suppose payed l b paid l c l wherefore first error much suppose paid l b must pay l c must pay l math l l wherfore second error much multiply first position second error product multiply second position first error product error much subtract lesser product greater product remaineth dividend likewise subtract lesser error greater error difference divisor perform division quotient answer thirdly error one bigg little respect rule foregoing answer would thus take first position error little take second position error much multiply position error crosswise product error unlike math viz one bigg another little add product together sum dividend likewise add error together sum divisor finished division find quotient answer found several tryals proof work say l paid b paid c paid sum total value building equal given number desire see demonstration rule let read chapter mr kersyes appendix wingates arithmetick petiscus book
