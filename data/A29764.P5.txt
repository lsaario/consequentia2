observing way sun degree high zenith set turning sight leg center set object sight one hole line head leg nigher turning sight brightnesse dimnesse sun allow see shadow looking small hole horizon sight till see horizon cut crosse bar great hole turning sight turning foreside sight till fit receive shadow middle object sight degree cut horizon sight shall sun true distance zenith complement altitude vii note adding short peece inch long head leg whereon set slideing shadow sight may obtain former convenience angle way also steady easie manner observation note whatsoever set forward peece must substracted sight sheweth remainder shall sun distance zenith required suppose set forward degree horizon sight stay rest sun distance zenith required thus see one line one manner figuring sun

observed place may note dexterious handling thereof naturally shew prevent x find latitude sea forward meridian observation altitude set moving object sight sun declination shewed day month rectifying table skrew turning sight leg center horizon sight moveable leg outside crosse piece according sun high low note forward observation respecting horizon ought degree high uncertain instrument whatsoever except plummet horizon uselesse observe forward observation moving horizon sight till see sun horizon sight horizon object sight contrary moving sight set day month declination whatsoever moving sight shall shew add shall latitude place required observing difference north south latitude setting sight proper declination either like unlike latitude example suppose march sun declination north first year leap year set stroke middle moving object sight north declination horizon sight moveable leg move higher lower till see horizon one sun degree sun meridian altitude noon suppose stayed counting degree shall find come add make latitude required take minute remains complement latitude note way may take forward observation save removing urning sight note also horizon sight shall stay corner may move object sight degree towards head must add degree sight stayed shall set sight way degr must add much suppose last observation latitude degree shall find sight play neer corner prove inconvenient suppose instead set degree north declination degree added declination sun height sight stay add degree doth make must add degree increased declination degree note reason set south declination diminished degree instead must add place sight would stayed thus see may neatly avoid inconvenience set sight proper steady observation time observation xi find latitude backward meridian observation sea converse former set one sight declination either directly augmented diminishd moving sight shall stay corner triangular quadrant slipt fro outside crosse peece till shadow outer edge shall fall middle turning sight lesse added number moving sight stayed according set first horizon sight declination shall true latitude required example suppose day year noon time set horizon sight north declination shall find moving sight stay neer corner sun shine bright cast shadow turning sight set horison sight declination forward degree moving sight coming lower add shall stay summe shall latitude likely better diminish degree moving sight stay crosse piece much better cast shadow look horizon turning sight horizon shall find shadow former edge moving shadow sight stay add degree diminished make latitude required note also better convenience shadow sight found true declination taught set moving object sight crosse piece counted towards head leg like latitude declination way unlike latitude declination observing back observation wheresoever sight shall stay shall complement latitude required add diminish consider accordingly note likewise declination nere solstice way latitude diminishing otherwise moving sight shall fall beyond crosse piece added degree diminished together whatsoever sight shall stay beyond must taken added sum remainder shall latitude required example suppose iune latitude north better holding sake diminish declination degree stead setting north declination set south sun degree high stay beyond way added diminished make take rest latitude required xii find latitude thred plummet observation made without respecting horizon count declination cross peece let equinoctiall let declination latitude counted toward moveable leg contrary way u north latitude north declination toward moveable leg south declination contrary contrarily south latitude thereunto set middest sliding object horizon sight small hole turning sight small hole horizon sight two hole whereby sun beam pierce shine one shall thred shew true latitude place required example suppose decem noon observe noon altitude set middle horizon sight counted toward head leg end making sun beam peirce hole turning sight shall find plummet play latitude required holding turning sight toward sun note also also may avoid inconvenience corner great distance sight remedy cited back forward observation move toward head leg thred fall short latitude toward moveable leg fall beyond latitude easie conceive thus see us forestaff quadrant mr gunters bow plainly properly applyed triangular quadrant sector easie perswade believe us gunters quadrant performed fully shewed use joyntrule may annexed number sign tangent versed sign make excellent large gunters rule cross peece good pair large compass operate therewith lastly may lie little roome much convenient stowage precious shall say use rest fully spoke author refer one usefull proposition inure use excellent instrument call triangular quadrant note finding latitude necessary table sun declination every four year viz leap year table sun declination whereby moneths laid table calculated mean year may well distinguish minute rule make exact fitted rectifying table every week year use thus hang thred center pin extend thred day moneth degree sun declination near common year look rectifying table moneth week seek shall find number minute must add substract declination found day year example suppose april second leap year rule sheweth rectifying table saith must substract true declination like year note space day sun swiftest motion much may consider hour day also finding latitude observation taken meridian anon shall see instrument exact let arithmetical calculation also laying sure foundation
