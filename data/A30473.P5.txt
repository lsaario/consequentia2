hold inexcusable error mean care taken digest matter christendom may due time advertised error avoided rome february censure opinion quietist prepared inquisition errori principali di quelli che esercitano loratione di quiete co le risposte la contemplatione vero oratione di quiete consiste constituirsi alla presenza di dio con un atto di fede oscura pura amorosa e dipoi senza passar piu avanti e senza ammettere discorso specie pensiero alcuno starsene cosi otioso par esser contrario alla riverenza dovuta dio il replicare quel purissimo atto il quale pero e di tanto merito e vigore che contiene se anzi supera con gran vantaggio tutti insieme li meriti delle altre virtu e persevera tutt il tempo della vita mentre non si ritratti con un atto contrario onde non e necessario reiterarlo e replicarlo censura e ri posta niun atto di fede ci constituisse presenti dio il quale e dentro noi per indispensabile necessita della ua immensit e pero spesso dicevano elia michea altri proseti vivit deus cujus conspectusto e con agostino dicono teologi deo vivimus movemur sumus dunque latto di fede perche suppone lestere della creatura suppone questa gia prima nella presenza di dio e solamente sara rassegnatione di spirito nelle braccie della divinita intorno questa hora sara contemplatione quando lanima contemplara e non sara otiosa doppo il primo atto di fede oscura pura amorosa e poifalfita evidente il dire che non sono necessarii altri buoni atti latto buono per e er finito e migliorabile per mezzo della continuatione di simili atti ne la moltiplicatione di atti virtuoso econtrario alla riverenza dovuta dio perche iddio non si tedia impedisce essendo libero daogni passione tanto non conviene replicare atti riverentiali maggiori del mondo quanto che questi secondo che porta lesperienza sono alterabili impedibili tediabili della vista di simili atti frequentati latto dunque se stesso buono moltiplicato sara un buono maggiore e pero da dio approvato piu rimunerabile che un atto solo nella contemplatione poi si sta atto di operare e non ostinatamente sopra lattopassato essendo il contemplare loperare mentalmente ancorche altro anco vi si richieda ii senza la contemplatione per mezzo della meditatione non puo darsi un passo nella perfettione r responso per meditarsi dal christiano precisamente la passione di christo si riflette che per amor dell huomo tanto pati un dio unde puo risolvarsi riamarlo e volerlo obedire che commanda e mettere prattica con la gratia di dio che sempre e noi tal santa deliberatione dunque permezzo della meditatione puo bene incaminarsi lanima alla perfettione anni senza contemplare e senza meditare purche sopri secondo li leggi con lajuto di dio fi puo ogn uno salvare non si salva poi chi non e perfetto amico di dio dunque e falsissima lopinione contenuta nel secondo capo iii la scienza e dottrina anche teologica e sacrum e dimpedimento e repugnanza alla contemplatione della quale non possono dar giuditio gli huomini dotti solo li meditativi e contemplativi r responso la dottrina teologica notifica stabili noi loggetto della contemplatione che dicono quietisti esser la divina essenza dunque noi e compinibile con la contemplatione alla quale se la teologia repugnasse listesso sarebbe esser contemplativo e nulla saper diddio teologalmente e cosi agostino e gli altri santi dottori e luminari della chiesa perche erano scientifici si doverebbero incapaci esser stati della contemplatione il che e falso imperoche dio che institui il sacerdotio come ministero il piu degno non ragione che habbia voluto sacerdoti che non fossero contemplativi gia che volse col sacerdotio unita la scienza mentre nella sacrum scrittura minaccio per osea profetta chi disprezzatore della scienza esercitava il sacerdotio tu repulisti scientiam ego repellam te ne sacerdotio fungaris mihi e tralascio altre scritture e raggioni perche mi viene incaricata la breuita quanto poi al che si dice questo cap che della contemplatione non possono dar giuditio li dotti si vede apertamente che lignoranza di questi spiritelli senza intelligenza ha una temerita di non volar soggiacere emenda per mezzo dell infallibile sentimento de scientifici iv non puo darsi perfetta contemplatione se non circa la sola divinita misteri dell incarnanatione vita e passione del nostro salvatore non sono oggetto di contemplatione anzi limpediscono onde devono da contemplativi tenersi lontani solo considerarsi spregiatamente r responso se la contemplatione e un affettione dell intelletto e della volonta con logetto mediante la gratia di dio un raccoglimento di spirito potra la vita di christo contemplarsi perche quella il christiano puo farsi presente spirito affettive con atto di fede amore aggiongo che se christo venne piantar paradisi terra per commissione dell eterno padre come disse il profeta isaia posui verbum meum ore tuo ut plantos coelos fundes terram dove la parafrase caldea cosi legge ut plantes coelos terra come dire si come lintese girolamo che piantasse le contentezze negli huomini disgratiati per il peccato originale e se contemplationi si portano sopra se stessi alla consolationi divine nella loro contemplativi perche si deve disprezzare e tener lontano christo che e limmediato datore christo non impedisce latto del contemplatione se ne compartirci perfettioni e contenti spirituali che sono il fine de contemplativi v le penitenze corporali lausterita della vita non convengono alli contemplativi anzi meglio si comincia la conversione dalla vita contemplativa che dalla purgativa e dalle penitenze ancora gli effetti della divotione sensioile la tenerezza del cuore le lagrime e consolationi spirituali si devono fuggire anzi dispreggiare da contemplativi come cose repugnanti alla contemplatione r responso le mortificationi dispongono lo spirito accio viva sopra le motioni del senso e percio tutti santi cominciarono viaggiare verso la perfettione con discipline digiuni c dunque se contemplativi hanno per fine anco la perfettione ben li convengono le penitenze perche piu spedito si renda alla contemplatione chi piu tiene domate le alterationi del senso e se dio promette nelle scritture pardonar al peccatore piante che saranno da lui le colpe nessun luogo del vecchio nuovo testamento per essersi posto nella contemplatione dunque meglio si comincia la conversione dalla vita purgativa e dalle penitenze che dalla contemplatione vi la vera contemplatione deve fermarsi nella pura essenza diddio spogliata delle persone e degli attributi e latto di fede di dio cosi concepito e piu perfetto e meritorio di quello che riguarda dio con le persone attributi r responso le persone divine egli adorabili attributi di dio hanno la raggione formale desser oggetti di fede edamore nel racoglimento delle nostre potenze e nella rassegnatione dello spirito perche sono verita rivelate e come predicati divini suoni buoni se stessi alle creature donde puo darsene vera contemplatione che poi latto di fede di dio senza le persone attributi concepito sia piu perfetto e meritorio di quello che riguarda dio con le persone attributi e falsita perche se gia il credere che dio sia trino e sia giusto e atto di fede perfetto e meritorio e credere dio vero nell essenza anco e atto meritorio e perfetto sara latto con cui si crede dio vero erino e giusto piu perfetto e meritorio dun altro atto con cui solamente si crede uno nell essenza perche si merita piu per due atti dell istessa virtu che per un solo di questi havendoci dio communicate le virtu supranaturali non per sar un atto solo virtuoso per avanzarsi col esercitio li talus doni un atto di fede che equivale due e piu meritorio e perfetto di un solo atto delli due onde ben si conclude contra la prima propositione di questo cap che la vera e perfetta contemplatione per essere megliore deve fermarsi nella pura essenza di dio questa nella persone e negli attributi vii nella contemplatione sunisee lanima immediatamente con dio onde non vi si richiede fantasmi imagini specie di sorte alcuna r responso nella contemplatione ancorche un certo modo sunisca lanima immediatamente con dio cio e effettiye perche vi concorre lintelletto mirar dio semplicemente pero si richiede qualche specie per sollicitare lintellettuale habilita naturale portarsi nella consideratione di dio servendo la specie per oggetto mottivo intelletto viii tutti contemplativi nell atto della contemplatione patiscono pene angoscie si gravi che pareggiano anzi superano li tormenti dell istessi martiri r responso se come dicono quietisti nel primo capo la contemplatione consiste nel farsi presente dio con un atto di fede amorosa e poi starsene otio non e formalmente essere tormentato e patire pene piu delli martiri e quantunque ad alcuno spesso succeda nella contemplatione angoscie e dolori cio proviene da altra causa dal demonio permettendolo dio da fiachezza di natura che consuma il corpo da motivi di malenconia da soverchio sangue che sormontato alla testa caggiona dolore moltissimi altri si sono visti nell atto della contemplatione circondati di luce con fronte serena e bocca ridente come francesco di paola fu osservato da luiggi xi di francia e finita la contemplatione restar tutti inondati di allegrezza perche quella vennero vista semplicemente ben si li sposi per restar concertato il matrimonio fra dio e lanima ix nel sagrificio della messa e nelle feste de santi e meglio applicarsi atto di pura fede e contemplatione che alli misteri di esso sacrificio considerare le attioni ele cose aptenenti alli medesimi santi r responso vive ingannato chi giudica entrare nella contemplatione senza buona dispositione dell anima e perche la consideratione delli mister della messa e dellesempio de santi e preparamento spirituale ancorche remoto percio stimarsi deve meglio prima applicarsi il christiano alla consideratione de misteri della messa e delle attioni de santi e poscia darsi alla contemplatione con piu adobbo nell anima x la lettione spirituale de libri le prediche lorationi vocali linvocationi desanti e cose simili sono dimpedimento alla contemplatione overo oratione di quiete alla quale non si deve premettere preparatione alcuna r responso se ogni professione e maggiormente quella della vera e non fintionata spiritualita nemo repente sit summus come lesperienza dimostra perche e ordine della nostra fiacca natura co cui si va accommodando la gratia per il nostro camino ultimo termine dell eternita che facilioribus sit incipiendum che percio e grand ignoranza e presontione entrare nell oratione di quiete prima daltri esercitii e senza preparatione chi cosi entra uscira ancora senz aleun profitto xi il sacramento della penitenza avanti la communione non e per lanime interiori e contemplative per lesteriori e meditative r contemplativi hanno solamente un anima che e puo meditare e puo contemplare anco puo star peccato dunque il sacramento della penitenza prima della communione e necessario anime contemplative xii la meditatione non riguarda dio col lume della fede con il lume naturale spirito e verita e pero non ha merito appresso dio r responso se la meditatione non fosse meritoria appresso dio saltem aliqualiter de congruo sarebbe cosi famigliare alle religioni dove furono e sono grand huomini fanali della c r ne sarebbe incaricata da s patriarchi e da sommi pontefici rimunerata con indulgenze plenarie come esercitio spirituale proportionato alli amici di dio quelli che abandonano le fallacie del mondo di dio come si puo conoscere lesistenza col lume naturale e con la fede sopranaturale cosi puo darsi meditatione che lo riguardi naturalmente e meditatione che lo riguardi con fede pura e sopranaturale xiii limagini non solo interne e mentali anco lesterne solite venerarsi da fedeli come sono quelle di christo e de suoi santi sono dannose contemplativi onde devono fuggirsi e toglier via accio non impediscano la contemplatione r responso quanto decreto e decretara la madre chiesa cui presiede direttore lo spirito santo tutto giovevole vassallaggio di christo pero se fedeli la chiesa ordina ladorationi delle s immagini non devono queste uggirsi toglier via come nocive alla contemplatione nulladimeno alcuni sguardi alla sfuggita verso dette immagini non sono valevoli far perdere la contemplatione overo oratione di quiete al contemplativo quale se ogni caso la perde proviene dalla sua troppa imbecillita e per altro poi e piu ampia lanima raggionevole e maggine la gratia che lassiste di quello che suppone queste cap anzi la moderata consideratione di dette imagini serve formar nell anima linterno racoglimento perche il contemplativo si faccia regolare dalla gratia xiv chi una volta si e applicato alla contemplatione non deve piu ritornare alla meditatione perche sarebbe un passare dal meglio al peggio r responso e vero che e cosa mala passare dal meglio al peggio spesso conviene non possedendo attualmente meglio incaminarsi posseder il buono e vero ancora che essendo pontualmente nella contemplatione non si deve lacciar questa fine di mettarsi nella meditatione ancorche la contemplatione sia migliore non ritrovandosi il christiano attualmente nella contemplatione non opera inconvenientemente applicandosi meditare perche conviene che per ogni via che dio si puo mirare dall anima sia da questa riverentemente essequiata xv se nel tempo della contemplatione vengono pensieribrutti osceni non si deve usar diligenza alcuna scacicarli riccorrer ad alcu uno buon pensiero compiacersi di essere da quelli molestato r responso per non perdersi lunione effettiva con dio che nella formale contemplatione si trova e atto di prudenza toglier via loccasione come e atto di scioperaggine il trattenersi con compiacenza perche come dice tomaso daquino qui vult causam ex quanecessario vel regulariter sequitur affectus vult virtualiter effectum e lo spirito santo qui amat periculum peribit illo dunque sentendo noi la rebellione del senso nella contemplatione ancorche fidati noi stessi dobbiamo usar ogni diligenza per superarla dovemo pero raccommandarci alla divinita e chieder la sua gratia per tranquillare mali pensieri diffondere le sue gioie nell anima incalmare sensi alterati ut sint aspera vias planas xvi niun atto affetto nostro interno benche formato per mezzo della fede e puro ne piace dio perche nasce dall amor proprio mentre non vi sia infuso dallo spirito santo sensa nostra industria e diligenza alcuna onde quelli che stanno nella contemplatione oratione daffetti devono stare otiosi aspettando linflusso dello spirito santo r responso dio solamente piacciono suoi doni tutte quelle nostre operationi che da noi si fanno con la sua santa gratia quindi tanto pier profetta sara la contemplatione quanto meno sara otiosa purche il contemplatore non si lasci da qualche sensibile trasportare preche perderia la contemplatione e gli succederabbe come alla moglie di loth che per mirar indietro perse il camino e poi temerita aspettare otiosita linflusso miracosa dallo spirito santo perche quei che sono nell oratione di quiete non si deve il camino passivo mentre non hanno condegnita sopra doni della spirito santo bensi succede alle volta che lo spirito penetri l anima di chi sta nell oratione daffetti per gratia particolare aggiongo contro la prima propositione di questo capo li quietisti dicono nel capo che la meditatione non ha merito appresso dio perche non lo riguarda col lume della fede dunque latto formato per mezzo della fede ha merito appresso dio dunque e puro e gli piace xvii quelli che stanno nell atto della contemplatione dell oratione di quiete siano persone religiose figli di famiglia altri che vivono sotto laltrui commando non devono quel tempo obedire eseguire gli ordini della regola de superiori per non interrompere la contemplatione r responso la contemplatione ancorche sia noi di gran perfettione perche non ci viene commandata da dio interrompendosi non si pecca essendoci commandata da dio lobedienza genitori superiori si deve obedire questi anco con lasciare lattual contemplatione perche riguardo dell ordine divino lobedienza e preferibile nella prattica ancorche la contemplatione sia molto piu considerabile nella sua perfettione objettiva xviii devono contemplativi esser totalmente spogliati dell affetto di tutte le cose che rigettino se e dispreggino li doni e favori di dio e si disaffettionino dell istessa virtu per maggiormente spogliarsi dogni cosa e viver meglio se medisimi fare ancora quello che ripugno alla modestia honesta purche non sia espressamente contro liprecetti del decalogo r responso iddio favorisce contemplativi con la communicatione de suoi boni non per essere questi disprezzati per abbellirgli lanima e fortificargli lhabilita naturale esercitio della virtu dvnque ancorche contemplativi non se ne debbano insuperbire devono sopramodo stimarli servirsene con humilta di spirito e se dio vuole lhonesta come buona sono obligo anche contemplativi esser honesti perche iddio non ha fatto decreto che privilegiasse contemplativi non esser sogetti alla raggione su la quale si fonde la modestia e l honesta della vita xix li contemplativi sono sogetti alle violenze per le quali restano privi dell uso del libero arbitrio si che se anco bene gravissimamente peccano esteriormente nondimeno interiormente non fanno peccato alcuno onde ne anco devono confessarsi di cio che hanno fatto cio si prova con lesempio di giob il quale con tutto che non solo ingiuriasse il prossimo anco bestemmiasse empiamente dio ogni modo non peccava perche tutto questo faceva per violenza del demonio e per dar giuditio di queste violenze non serve la teologia scolastica e morale e necessario spirito sopranaturale il quale pocchissimi si trova questi sha da giudicare non linterno dall esterno lesterno dall interno r responso che questo cap non solamente latet anguis sub herha apertamente si vede che sotto nome di contemplativi spirituali vogliono quietisti essere debacanti sensuali lesempio che adducono di giob ben dimostra che hanno intelligenza della scrittura mai giob pecco esteriormente ne contro il prossimo ne contro dio quando parlo nel cap nel vorso come ben dimonstra anco per mezzo del senso litterale pineda tom sopra giob c ne pecco contro il prossimo come nell istesso puo vedersi sempre fondata su la dottrina de s padri che delle scritture e insegnano il vero senso e per dirla poche parole con altre raggioni la gratia con la quale iddio sempre ci assiste unita con la nostra cooperatione puo superare ogni assalto nemico e christo lo disse tti persona di paolo sufficit tibi gratia mea dunque il contemplativo non e violentabile de venghi necessitato al peccato este iori c principal error practise prayer quietness censured refuted error contemplation
