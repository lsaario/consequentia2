scale equal part drawn center general manifold use mr gunter book sector hath shewed brief touch whereof take first place way use rule business intended better hereof needful explain three four term avoiding many word needle repetition brief yet plain discourse first word lateral meant distance taken either foot inch scale degree minute chord taken counted center midst head jointrule along one leg thus suppose would take foot laterally set one point compass center head open one leg scale extent call lateral extent foot also take lateral chord degree shall find extent compass center center foot scale foot inch word parallel mean distance taken setting one point compass number foot inch one leg point number leg across one leg thus rule opened extent compass one leg leg parallel extent parallel extent must set one point compass common line one leg common line leg common line scale run center centerpins nearest distance point line thus set one point compass point given open shut turned till touch cleave line call nearest distance use lay line shall represent number foot inch given required take number given laterally scale center line required scale great small take number part length thereof laterally example suppose would inch represent foot take inch compass make parallel scale set desire use ii increase diminish line proportion take given line compass make parallel part thereof parallel extent part would increased diminished augmentation diminution required example let inch represent foot proportion would foot foot viz le take inch compass make parallel scale parallel distance doth diminish line parallel doth increase line proportion required use iii divide line number part model take given line make parallel part scale would divided parallel extent shall divide line accordingly example let inch line divided part take inch distance whatsoever make parallel scale parallel distance shall divide inch part required note exactness conveniency may double triple viz make line divided parallel triple number must take stead one shall divide line part required example would inch put part take inch compass make parrallel triple take parallel triple one shall divide line given inch part model exactly like note rule stand may take number part model whatsoever scale use iv two line given find proportion one another according number take line severally lay laterally center scale please number foot inch reach shall shew proportion one another part line measured example line suppose one inch long unknown part take inch measure one line measure laterally scale give foot inch take inch supposed length line give laterally foot inch say one line foot half inch foot inch scale foot inch quarter length conclude term number one line make line parallel part thereof take line carry parallelly till stay like part leg common line shall denomination line use v two line given find third continual proportion take line lay laterally leg note foot

foot long another foot would another bear proportion doth increasing number thus note first number second first line laid center scale extends foot inch inch second line give foot inch lateral second line viz foot inch made parallel foot inch term first line take parallel extent foot inch measure shall give foot inch laid laterally center third proportional required measured inch inch third answer required proportion third part line number quantity line given number thus extent compass first number second number shall reach way second number third proportional number required use vi divide line sort another line divided take whole line divided lay laterally leg fit line divided parallelly end thereof lay every part divided line laterally like manner whole line laid parallel extent part shall
