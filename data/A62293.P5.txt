counted center midst head jointrule along one leg thus suppose would take 15 foot laterally set one point compass center head open 15 one leg 30 scale extent call lateral extent 15 foot also take lateral chord 60 degree shall find extent compass center 60 center 15 foot 30 scale foot inch 2 word parallel mean distance taken setting one point compass number foot inch one leg point number leg
