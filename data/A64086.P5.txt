throne recognizing title without taking notice pretended prince whose birth whether true false shall say thing one way shall trouble self inquire validity suspitions may render birth doubtful generality nation therefore first place desire take notice child carried away mother scarce yet six month old midwife chief witness could swear thing concerning queen really child brought bed likewise conveyed time france f grant infer hence two conclusion neither convention parliament obliged take notice right person tho heir crown dominion england necessary part member parliament neither body put claim crown upon demise king either death abdication case u claim made late convention highness prince orange behalf consort princess heir apparent crown convention obliged look farther supposed

convention proceeded examine matter without sufficient evidence could heard ex parie one side might sat long enough could come true decision matter whilst mean time whole nation want king danger utter ruin confusion f pray sir could parliament sent summons witness say france come give testimony great cause proceeded declared prince princess orange king queen may several good reason given first child carried dominion prince declared enemy religion civil interest english nation would never consented sent viewed convention appoint purpose without inspection nation could never morally assured child carried away since every one know infant age easily distinguisht one another time birth secondly reputed parent counting already injured convention declaring king abdicated government throne thereby become vacant would never obeyed summons convention sent looked upon authority summond sitting vertue king writ thirdly admitting french king would permitted supposed prince sent back king iames queen would obeyed summons yet safety nation stay rely upon since question could decided great part year slipt away left without king head u parliament sitting able raise money cannot legally done without king authority parliament french king might whilst thus quarrelling amongst self successor crown sent king iames great fleet army old soldier placed throne absolute ever since besides legal right succession grant might also set new right conquest kingdom thing seriously considered since safety people ought supream law ever hath agreed undoubted principle wise nation think done could well done case broken hereditary succession declaring king william queen mary lawful king queen since lawful queen might also declare king make treason conspire well parliament could case prince philip spain vid act mariae confirming treaty marriage king philip declared king joyntly queen mary tho right act parliament late convention declared administration government remain solely king william life put dispute none might doubt supream power lay since admit division f seems reasonable enough pray come pas king william enjoy crown queen life also heard squire highchurch parson last mentioned cry upon horrid breach hereditary succession also great wrong princess denmark heir supposed prince wale dead since directly contrary act recognition king iames whereby parliament declare lawful lineal heir crown descended eldest daughter king edward iv also thereby engage posterity yield obedience king iames right heir pray satisfie gentleman meet grant late king iames could abdicate crown without express consent declaring supposed prince king altogether unpracticable unsafe nation already proved think need concerned whether present majesty enjoys crown life long peace safety nation since end alone king iames set aside supposed prince past without much enquiring legitimacy convention lawful authority decide greater point certainly became parliament much authority decide settle le material part controversie viz settlement crown queen decease since former parliament done like case thus henry iv henry vii formally declared nay latter recognized lawful king authority parliament notwithstanding lineal heir blood alive ever henry vii married princess elizabeth daughter king edward iv crown settled upon heir body act may find print statutebooks tho right succession since mother countess richmond right could pretend crown derived alive made cession true able prove hereditary succession right line never fundamental law kingdom secondly crown came claimed hereditary right older edward ists time parliament often taken upon break upon hereditary succession whenever safety necessity kingdom required thirdly king thus succeeded without lineal right succession reign owned true legal king attainder treason holding good person conspired also reign ended see act parliament made stand good day unless repealed subsequent parliament question made present parliament much power settle crown upon present majesty life settle upon king henry iv henry vii heir body since prince could deserve nation freeing tyranny two richards ii iii present majesty hath done freeing u arbitrary power king iames let tell farther gentleman mention mistaken repetition act recognition king iames ists title though true acknowledged undoubted lineal heir crown yet act tie oblige posterity right heir act parliament general promise obedience loyalty king royal progeny sure none deny present majesty true progeny king iames ist f grant seems reasonable gentleman mentioned also said henry iv reign king edward iv declared usurper act parliament henry seventh either title house lancaster tacite concession mother else york like tacite concession princess elizabeth wife else concession usurper till married said princess heiress crown pray say sir pray tell gentleman quite supposition act parliament edward fourth sufficient authority prove henry fourth usurper give another act parliament though printed revers attainder king henry sixth margaret queen prince edward son wherein expresly declared vid par rolles h n king henry sixth contrary allegiance due order attainted high treason first year king edward fourth wherefore advice assent lord spiritual temporal assembled parliament enacted act attainder forfeiture disablement made said parliament said blessed prince king henry made void annulled repealed attainder henry sixth due order allegiance certainly said king must lawful king usurper time death certainly like must affirmed henry fourth descended claimed henry seventh formal cession right ever given countess mother princess wife either coming crown tacite implied cession expressed saying nothing pray tell may well suppose like tacite consent princess denmark making opposition protestation act whereby crown settled upon majesty life rather agreeing heard several servant house declare princess design future right hindrance present settlement pray therefore tell may king william hold crown death queen happen first die without usurpation well king henry seventh held death queen notwithstanding two son prince arthur henry lived married father died henry eighth nineteenth twentieth year age old enough conscience govern f confess thing altogether unknown believe condition give worship many thanks kind information pray sir resolve one question done think man may lawfully take new oath allegiance present majesty notwithstanding king iames still alive think could justifie law called account unexpected mean obtain throne well neighbour satisfie first question answer thus doubt may lawfully take oath since parliament done thus setling crown many former parliament done like case whose proceeding still looked upon good held unquestioned unto day appears president henry viith gave upon declaration parliament proper judge right crown case dispute people kingdom still thought sufficiently obliged take oath fidelity allegiance government thought fit frame require according law confess latter question somewhat harder answered depends upon matter farther remote since cannot tell whether ever king iames reobtain throne mean may happen force either irish french nation doubt made mere slave vassal without law setled property agreement composition upon engagement govern according law le tell self every subject take oath good plea law taking statute henry viith chap whereby expresly enacted every subject duty allegiance bound serve assist prince sovereign lord season need shall require follows act indemnity shall personally serve king time war altogether unreasonable allegiance due king sovereign lord mentioned preamble allegiance due certainly oath may lawfully taken observe since law hath ever required subject king statute common law appears lord cooke comment statute edward iiid asserts authority statute also old yearbook king de facto time lord king intended statute hath right possession within act see according act henry viith also judgment best lawyer england whatever person solemnly crowned king england hath recognized authority pariiament present majesty ever esteemed lawful rightful king queen though hereditary right succession next blood proved instance king henry could also example queen mary queen elizabeth take please since could succeed legitimate daughter heir king henry eighth plain one queen better parliamentary title crown therefore upon whole matter whether present majesty heir crown lineal descent question whether law england intent purpose lawful rightful king queen oath allegiance may lawfully taken men obliged serve war affair even king iames since cannot serve two master owe allegiance two king f cannot deny say seems reasonable also according law heard squire parson mentioned positively assert king parliament power alter succession crown though would therefore statute henry seventh mentioned indemnifies take arm defence king time void first made usurper right make law prejudice true king next heir crown also said temporary act last longer life lastly statute hath never allowed held good case assisting usurper since time duke northumberland arraigned executed treason time queen mary assisted taken arm behalf lady iane gray proclaimed queen reignd fortnight yet tho duke pleaded afterwards acted nothing order queen council time yet plea overruled peer judge executed notwithstanding lastly said statute implicitly consequence repealed statute queen elizabeth king iemes appoint oath allegiance taken king heir lawful successor besides statute king henry eighth made treason setled crown bequeath last usurp upon right could never king queen time must assisted obeyd subject realm rightfully therefore concluded statute henry seventh could make alteration ancient law concerning succession stand still statute made declared case edward fourth affirmed henry fourth fifth sixth king deed right pretended king statute setled crown upon henry fourth issue absolutely void duke york heir say doubt answer well enough therefore first objection would make statute henry viith void made usurper methinks might civil allowed lawful king right wife least statute made time marriage princess elizabeth indeed nothing betrays gentleman ignorance law since look ordinary statute book find statute king look upon usurper much force day enacted prince right line unless since repeald subsequent statute objection temporary law king life also vain since statute self mention thing speaks king time succeeding time without mention king henry viith particular judge lookt upon void law else repeald also false case duke northumberland prove though duke ever find plead statute trial yet think would helpt since king queen time within statute take solemnly crowned recognized free parliament one crown entaild statute never lady iane crown bestowd king edward viths letterspatents consequently title act parliament lastly statute henry viith never repeald subsequent act likely certain never heard act parliament could ever repeald implication express word indeed none statute mention done much implication though oath allegiance supremacy taken king queen heir lawful successor yet heir lawful successor shall known law declare law shall king parliament sole supream legislator law day appears undeniable authority statute elizabeth declared treason life queen person affirm queen parliament power make law limit bind govern succession crown possession remainder reversion shew statute still force every person holding affirming said queen decease shall forfeit land good statute henry viiith help least appears statute self treason thereby enacted could arise thence extend farther person therein mentiond succession crown right line setled confirmed statute clear contrary since king henry power statute bequeath crown last testament seal sign manual afterwards actually took upon law still continues act edward ivth mentioned made
