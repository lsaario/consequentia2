go great way answering greatest difficulty viz eternal punishment wicked men next world objection god punishing wicked men next world body pretend unjust god punish wicked whether world next objection nature punishment indeed distinctly know know happiness heaven description saviour give lake fire brimstome blackness darkness worm never dieth fire never goeth prove great description intended present u frightful terrible image misery damned complaint neither confessed wicked men deserve miserable objection vast disproportion time eternity reconcilable divine justice punish temporal sin
