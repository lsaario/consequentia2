heart second habitual grace principle inclining heart promise love love justified love love receptive grace applying promise doth sweeten heart reference god putteth u upon good thought god look upon severe judg taking opportunity damn u gracious loving father reconciled u blood christ therefore faith love likewise doth expell tormenting fear doubt thus apostle notably john fear love perfect love casteth fear fear hath torment feareth viz slavish manner made perfect love see text nature slavish fear proper effect filial love god slavish fear tormenting doth every soul exercised therewith subscribe thereunto servile fear almost like torment hell self intolerable fear god cain juda dreadfull apprehension god wrath thus fear produceth spiritual hornet soul sting day night love perfected

bear patiently neither entertain hard thought god severe punish u sin deserve removeth suspicious thought guilt apt raise u god become enemy interpreting every thing worst sense yea love seeketh god honoured great name magnified glorified mattereth consent ease therefore though god leave long desertion though manifold temptation yet saith god good loveth god even god seemeth love may truly say solomon cant love strong death coales thereof coales fire many water cannot quench love many flood cannot drown certainly true humane love much divine love therefore thou wouldst thy heart setled upon promise preserve love like fire upon altar thy heart daily thirdly another habitual principle confirm heart upon promise heavenly courage spiritual fortitude spiritual fortitude heavenly courage aristotle maketh fortitude moral vertue man either doth suffereth great thing vertues sake christian fortitude sublime nature neither speak enduring great thing man god may see david many time ready sink heavy temptation conflicting see holy generosity recovereth self psal say unto god rock hast thou forgotten c art thou cast soul art thou disquieted hope god hence david exhorteth hope god psal good courage god shall strengthen heart temptation none grievous born arise god withdrawing hiding face u apprehend promise belong unto u question principle like ship tossed sea without pilot anchor therefore spiritual fortitude withstand strong assault required many sunk irrecoverably pit destruction unlesse god power settle u unlesse compose heart well remove mountain sad sainting spirit lay

sixthly sealing doth imply secrecy privacy closely secrecy privacy reserved deut laid store sealed among treasure saith god thus also iob saith cap transgression sealed bag god take speciall notice
