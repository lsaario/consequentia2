large city nation wholly depend trade removed would soon deserted respective inhabitant cannot offer consideration nobility gentry farmer would find market commodity find price answerable particular larger remove mistake destructive nation pestilence self mentioned opponent viz interest merchant interest clothier artificer consistant interest nobility gentry contrary made sufficiently appear thirdly opponent third argument wooll l per pack year prohibited following year sold l per pack wool hath ever since reason said prohibition abated pretended price worth pound per pack argument seems failure two respect one wool nation hath never bore price since time prohibition whereas may made appear year wooll bore considerable price l per pack l per pack according goodness said wool continued time shews u mistake argument fall price wool wholly ascribed prohibition whereas indeed two cause evident first discouragement hath put upon clothier upon vent woollen manufacture french king arbitrary imposition upon almost utter prohibition wherby cannot much wrought formerly otherwise certainly occasion pretence would taken complain superfluous woll therefore cannot denied true cause wool come unwrought formerly ti clear men pleaded opponent mean stealer transporter wool canterbury place adjacent necessity filthy greediness gain lucre highly contributed notwithstanding law nation notwithstanding ruine nation daily jeopardied respect cannot confess rumney marsh hath indeed created interest self interest neither hath consistent interest nation interest nobility gentry general said stealer transporter wooll main principal cause inconvenience viz loss manufacture lowring price wool cause fall price wool especially late year hath necessitating ireland stock pasturegrounds sheep instead great cattel best breed england mean wool hath late year increased ever time within majesty dominion consequence extraordinary increase fault clothier manufacturer hath brought price hath occasioned great quantity sent abroad forreign part bear almost small price beyond sea therefore argument opponent hath assigned cause cause may clearly appear matter fact wool bore good price said prohibition many year till breach commerce put upon u french king mentioned untill unfortunate act must humbly crave leave call made importing irish cattle upon supposition would raise price land england whereas quite contrary effect hath much experiencd viz hath laid foundation impoverishing england quickly fear recovered next thing alleadged opponent limited exportation wool advantage woollen trade le beyond sea hindring hath assertion opponent really sufficiently effectually made good might justly merited name greatest master reason england indeed seeing paradox strange hard conceived could easily stated could expect argument remarkable ordinary would immediatly followed finding contrary expectation nothing beyond bare affirmation stranger liberty buy wooll soever please would pay dearer much clothier would therefore cheaper advantage would able sell stranger manufacture say finding little nothing brought either way reason argument maintain paradox soon convinced remained uncapable proved little evidence improbability said consequence shall offer reason contrary first crave leave say way likely grower part england willing get utmost price wooll therefore likely grower whatsoever sell wool native countrey le price presumes may stranger therefore likely manufacturer buy cheaper others admitting made unlawful stranger buy wool till time season year end clothier might first provide need yet would way follow stranger may agent factor may purchase ease conveniency rate clothier like perceive thing propounded opponent would able least either prevent

way possibly limited neither see clothier sufficiently certainly furnished manufacture self capable way preserved mischief inconvenience cannot follow cannot necessary consequence law propounded opponent nothing obviate prevent inconvenience hath either regarded much attempted cannot take great blot judgment barely boldly offer thing attended much hazard fourthly opponent seems put chiefest stress viz large custom may put upon wooll exported stranger least mean may come pay double price clothier mean also majesty may receive advantage custom imposed upon try weight strength expedient rather shew vanity let u suppose per pound shall law imposed upon wool shall shipped stranger others follow said custom paid majestie one half wooll shall shipt seeing colour pack many hundred may

cheaper french make though shall give double treble price give wool next thing alledged opponent fore father never prohibit transportation wooll unless upon great occasion certain season till late year making good summary several statute brought time edw downwards time answer statute shall make use argument opponent hath put mouth wool many age wisdom government least often prohibited

late improved trade commerce exported shipping france portugal spain italy turkey remote part world mean wealth came greatly encrease self became powerful shipping ever greatness trade strength shipping observed forthwith emulated neighbour eing likewise clearly discerned chiefest mean maintenance proceeded woollen manufacture hollander therefore first french since many undue law pressure

manufacturer must necessity far greater disadvantage reference furnishing stranger abroad regard cannot thought able raise stock money stranger prevent stranger forestalling consequently lawful talk reason ground imagine manufacture short time utterly lost lost trade strength sea must inevitably lost honour wealth rent priviledges liberty property nation must hazarded stranger shall carry away trade strength u fourthly next allegation made opponent viz transportation wooll better majesty customes see little may require answer much spoken already fourth head nevertheless must crave leave say opponent also goeth upon extraordinary mistake dispute u whether majesty customes would bettered subsidy paid wooll exported stead stoln dispute u strictly majesty customes hereafter amount comparitively present case law free unlimited exportation wooll reason law consequence must follow wollen manufacture shall come wholly entirely lost becomes wise man must civility judge opponent

customes time come admitting inconvenience mentioned unavoidable law propounded opponent besides opponent cannot doubtless ignorant considered greatness majesty customes day greater ever raised comparatively export import time greater export value import must proportionally fall quantity manufacture shall fail carried raw unwrought wooll alone shall stead exported consequently pretend law
