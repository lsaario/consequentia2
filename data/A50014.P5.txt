whatsoever v second objection heaviness body heaviness body seems thing contrary circumvolution earth heavy body high fall earth strait line supposing circular motion earth stone let fall top tower fall plumb bottom mean time stone falling earth bear tower move many cubit therefore stone case earth moved would light foot tower good distance contrary daily experience vi ne ng top tower carried twofold motion objection tho accounted great weight adversary nevertheless easie enough answered consider every heavy body besides motion downwards another imprest upon earth whirling round axis whereby self body carried along therefore twofold motion stone fall tower one straight motion whereby fall ground circular whereby earth carried along coelestial matter surround therefore necessary stone fallen tower fall distance since carried swiftness stone cannot fall plumb foot tower contradiction philosophy one motion compounded straight circular aristotle owns much attribute fire straight
