bond conscience god word already spoken secondly relative bond conscience bindeth conscience indeed onely relation god word god word putteth authority upon latter also two sort others may bind conscience self may bind conscience others may bind conscience others may bind conscience namely authority conferred upon god law command receive vigour force god law thus law command magistrate bind conscience people parent bind conscience child master bind conscience servant though bind conscience commandment men yet god seal authority upon set conclusion whereby ye may know farre law commandment others bind bind conscience conclusion magistrate power command u let every soul subject higher power power god power ordained god rom chapter doth clearly prove conclusion unto u first part chapter learn magistrate power authority make law establish order among men therefore called power learn law magistrate receive strength force law god power ordained god saith text law made magistrate confirmed god power bind conscience vers wherefore must subject onely wrath also conscience sake violating sinne authority confirmed god cannot resist resist ordinance god saith apostle nay may pull condemnation upon u resist shall receive condemnation vers first conclusion telleth u law men obeyed viz virtually flow god word though expressely commanded good wholesome profitable commonwealth though particularly commanded god word yet virtue injoyned therefore neglect disobedient unto neglect disobedient god farre onely obeyed farre onely say virtually flow god word farre onely receive force god law first conclusion conclusion commandment magistrate authoritie lose power binding conscience foure case command though self simply absolutely sinfull unlawfull yet doth put u upon necessity sinning example magistrate command single life minister thing self simply unlawfull lawfull marry lawfull marry yet commandment unlawfull would put minister upon necessity sinning reason power therefore commandment would bind conscience conscience cannot bound impurity apparent danger impurity therefore though thing simply unlawfull yet commandment simply unlawfull doth bind conscience apostle maketh commandment argue seared conscience commander therefore none seared conscience think bound tim commandment magistrate lose power binding conscience command thing unlawfull contrary word god case bind conscience god seal example three blessed childrendan king commanded worship image set conceive bound conscience obey would rather suffer torment obey also daniel commanded ask petition god thirty dayes space onely king daniel conceive bound conscience nay chose rather cast den lion obeydan case answer apostle necessary commanded preach name lord jesus thus answered whether right sight god obey men rather god judge ye men law command overthrow libertie christianitie christian libertie christ hath purchased u lose power binding conscience must tell caution viz libertie may considered double respect regard self libertie self regard exercise use libertie great difference two consideration great difference man sword man wearing sword magistrate may restrain man wearing sword time though take sword difference libertie using libertie libertie purchased god child whereby thing become lawfull unto thing lawfull unto rom saith paul cor nothing evil self speaketh indifferent thing god child freed observation meat drink time garment whatsoever commandment made magistrate contrarie libertie doth bind conscience nothing bind conscience christ doth loose yet may restraint use libertie example magistrate may command u forbear kind meat certain time also garment like namely doctrine meat drink garment pure therefore case command magistrate bindeth conscience otherwise command thing indifferent absolutely necessarie make idolatrous superstitious case unlawfull bind conscience obey idolatrous answer commanded either absolutely necessarie christianitie religion worship god much necessitie holinesse self hey made superstitious idolatrous case caveat st john strongly kept babe keep self idol john commanded thing meritorious pleasing god merit idolatrous commanded substantiall perfection religion though religion imperfect without made idolatrous lose virtue binding conscience command thing indifferent commanded without respect make idolatrous may obeyed second conclusion conclusion law commandment magistrate want authoritie god law confirm therefore bind conscience ought disobeyed scandal contempt unreverent slighting despising magistrate law must acknowledged magistrate god tim exhort supplication made king authoritie speaketh heathen king yet calleth king saith authoritie ought pray therefore much king magistrate subscribe christian religion nay though command utterly unlawfull must rise rise god must obey one way either actively passively command lawfull u must obey command unlawfull u threaten punishment cannot actively obey command god yet must passively obey suffering submitting penalty lord hath given authority u third conclusion conclusion law magistrate god law bind conscience yet matter scandal bind u obedience magistrate shall command thing beyond power command yet unlawfull u though command bind obedience case conscience yet case scandal doth thus christ content pay tribute though needed done child saith hematth free neverthelesse lest offend magistrate pay put example another nature private wrong though expressely bound yet rather scandalously contend conscience doth bind u yield needed abraham condescended farre unto lot let take choice rather scandal religion arise ye may reade thus briefly made manifest farre command magistrate bind conscience farre objection may objectedobj
