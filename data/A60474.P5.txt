continual adding equation together minute second may july shall gain minute second july october shall lose minute second october last january shall gain minute second understood well adjusted clock set right sun beginning time either gaining losing table would adjust clock mean time greatest exactness possible brought thus first set true sun note day let motion continued without setting new day observe time got lost sun summ whole number second included table two day first setting last observation allowing second minute gain loss clock equal summ time gained lost table well adjusted must motion reduced near agreement shortning pendulum case clock gone slow letting bob longer case gone fast set anew try day comparing loss gain summ equation contained table let bob rectified nature

shall come right dial set day twelvemonth n part year shall still differ dial example set right first february continued motion whole year shall continually slow whole year either le till day set reason plain enough first february may shall continually lose quantity minute second may july shall gain gaining amounting nine minute second shall still slow minute second gaining shall much lost minute second july shall lose afresh till october second loss amounting minute second added time slow last account shall amount minute second much shall slow october whence shall gain afresh till last

according unequality time made differ dial use set time setting may said month yet table well noted shall find time year good clock may go longer time without material difference time given dial example suppose set clock right sun first january clock let go till first march shall two minute four second fast though gain january six minute great matter yet losing next month four minute shall end month two minute fast nay let go another month last march shall differ seven minute great matter moreover set clock first may shall let go till june lose two minute thirty five second whole though shall beginning may five minute slow great matter also set right first june may well go without setting till first september though gain five minute june yet losing eight minute august shall three minute slow three month time time february may clock let go twill extreamly losing eighteen minute also november december january time gain thirty minute table may also readily find difference length two day manner first day shorter longer mean day substract equation table belonging one day equation remainder shall shew difference length day one longer mean shorter add two equation together summ shall time differ length thus tenth january found thirteen second longer tenth may also fifteenth september found fifty one second shorter fifteenth december note men nice keeping clock true sun make
