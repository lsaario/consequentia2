author asserts gravity intrinsecal quality body whereby tend downwards towards center earth yet afterwards toward end chapter affirms fire may rightly said gravitate upwards c definition true gravity intrinsecal quality body whereby tend towards center earth whether gravity understood faculty capacity tending actual exercise thereof cannot avoid repugnancy actual exercise thereof understood gravitation affirmed tending downwards body towards center earth contradiction tendency upwards gravitation rather levitation gravity understood capacity tending downwards center yet actuality thereof gravitation levity levitation therefore according notion gravity downwards learned author asserts gravitation also upwards say seems contradiction rather interpret emendation former assertion affirming gravitation upwards well downwards would insinuate really truth sense gravity gravitation understood school well upwards transverse oblique downwards way gravity gravitation school dream inherent quality body self may called gravity mere idolum fori lord verulam would call false notion sticking vulgar use sense word think learned author apertly acknowledge consequently explode usual
