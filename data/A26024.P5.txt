dignitates ac privilegia cum garterio ordine non esse comparanda permitte mihi serenissime rex ut augusta nobili hac corona ordinis periscelidis decora accuratius contempler quid mihi insuper mandatis sit datum humilime referam edwardi tertii incredibilem virtutem que fortitudinem omnis posteritas hunc u que diem est admirata semper qui cum vetustissimis angliae regibus originem traexerit nulli veterum tum rerum gestarum gloria tum invictissimi animi magnitudine tum summae faelicitatis admira tione videtur esse postponendus ab hoc inquam heroe laudatissimo fortissimo cum ordo hic garterius excogitatus sit inventus quid tanto instituto potest esse nobilius quid praeclarius summa quo que dignitas huic ordini ex eo aboritur quod non modo praecipuae nobilitatis viri potentissimi duce ac principe verum etiam imperatores reges eorum que liberi pulcherimo hoc honore semper fuerint cumulati magnificentiam dicti ordinis commendavit tum quod candidatus egregiis admirandis ornamentis investiatur installetur amiciatur tum quod ipso die georgii honorificentissimo superiorum inferiorum concursu mirifice condecoretur illustretur quemadmodum vero sacrum vestra regia majestas evidentibus rationibus commota clementissimae meae reginae parentem invictissimum heroem hoc ipso periscelidis splendore cumulandum judicarit ita exhibitio illa vel hoc nomine longe fuit clarissima quod spectante universo pene exercitu inter vehementissimam bellicorum tormentorum displosionem per vestros deputatos quidem ipsius dorussiae visceribus facta sit ad omnem ita que posteritatis memoriam commendatissimum erit quod licet exiguum tum temporis extiterit intervallum inter nostrum hostilem exercitum adeo ut convenientius tanto heroi fuisse nonnullis visum fuerit de corporis defensione quam de honoris alicujus accessione cogitare rejectis tamen omnibus periculis passus sit sibi tribui honorem condignum ordinis hujus clarissimi societatem se cooptari nec facile dixerim utrum huic accessioni plus dignitatis illatum ex eundem ordinem offerente vero recipiente ita enim utrarum que vestrum majestatum dignitas hic elucet ita aequabili lanci innititur ut discrimen non facile attendatur ac licet immensus mihi jam porrigatur campus laudes utrius que serenissimae vestrae regiae majestatis expatiandi cum tamen ita comparatum sit ut quo quis que laude dignior est eo minus patiatur laudes suas celebrari non velificabor impraesentiarum tantis majestatum vestrarum virtutibus sed ea tantum referam quae sine summa ingrati animi nota non possunt praeteriri successit sacrum vestra regia majestas parenti suo gloriosissimae recordationis tot regnorum administrationem quidem ita successit ut non solum paternis vestigiis laudabiliter inhaereat verum etiam paternarum virtutum dignissimum se ostendat haeredem pacem rem beatissimam omni studio complectatur subditis suis quietem omnium rerum affluentiam benignissime procuret quid sit quod serenissimam vestram regiam majestatem infinitis hominibus amabilem magi reddere possit quam omnium bonorum de eadem singulare judicium etenim cum omnibus pateat eandem naturali prope divina quadam propensione ea virtutes ornamenta quibus vita haec humana fulcitur ferri ab omnibus ii vitiis quibus contaminetur serio abhorrere cum que vita vestra omnis sit candoris integritatis castitatis honestatis plenissima non potest mihi vitio verti si oblata hac occasione illud ipsum jam commemorare aperte que dicam nullum praeter serenissimam vestram regiam majestatem tum extitisse excellentiorem regem digniorem qui ista amplissimorum proavis fortissimis acceptorum honorum ornamenta tanto regi tribuere conferre potuerit regis deinde hujus incomparabilis qualitates si accuratius contemplati fuerimus nemo inficiabitur quin omni honorum genere fuerit dignissimus habuit patrem avum qui indefesso studio ea semper consilia tractarunt quae non solum ad pacis tranquillitatem togae que foelicitatem antiquissimis suecorum gothorum regnis conservandam verum etiam ad armorum bene gerendorum gloriam bellicarum que rationum militaris disciplinae administrationem fovendam pertinent cum progenitoribus ortus esset industria labore incredibili que adeo brevi temporis spatio eo pervenit ut non solum illis pax verum etiam longe clarior celebrior fuerit cum que horrendae cujusdam virtutis amore inter omnes mortales teneretur talem se vita sua exhibuit ut omnes virtutes numeros quoad ejus ab homine fieri potuit explere conatus sit tanta quidem constantia ii sudoribus vigiliis ut eum tam laudabili proposito nec rei magnitudo deterrere nec ulla voluptas avocare potuerit ab incunabulis praeclarissimarum artium linguarum studio ita vehementer invigilavit ut postquam ad adultiorem aetatem pervenisset ad miraculum u que se ii oblectarit nec honorum optimorum authorum lectione ipsis castris que adeo bostium suorum quasi conspectu abstinuerit tantus praeterea hoc heroe fuit amor sollicitudo conservandae religionis libertatis germannia ut cum ejusdem principe tolerando quodam servitutis jugo praemerentur eos non solum adversus hostium ferociam tutatus est verum etiam avitos ducatus unde expulsi fuerant magna sua gloria magna ipsorum laetitia magno cum hostium dedecore per vim fortissime reduxerit pristinam que dignitatem reddiderit quam si iidem jam voluerint deserere sibi suae que socordiae inposterum imputabunt ac licet praeter ipsam dei benignitatem aliae etiam possint exhiberi rationes quibus hero hic innixus tam arduum opus aggredi voluit nulla tamen accommodatior certior co stitueretur quam scientia rei militaris fortitudo quaedam invicta etenim cum post mortem laudatissimi parentis triplici bello puta danico polonico muscovitico distineretur ita se bellicis artibus totum consecravit ita mancipavit ut cum summis imperatoribus non immerito suerit comparandus ad hanc rem promptius expediendum ita eum deus natura finierant ut visis hostibus vel summo vitae periculo constitutus nunquam trepidarit nunquam expalluerit nunquam aufugerit quin potius exigua militum manu saepe hostibus se objecerit eos sustinuerit iisdem maximas clade intulerit strages horrendas confecerit que adeo nobilissimas provincias incredibili robore extortus regno suecorum per se longe amplissimo gloriosissime adjecerit eximia hac militaris disciplinae administr tione ita orbi terrarum innotuit ut reges principe que complures infiniti praeterea homines ad eum amandum colendum sint inflammati non inficiaberis serenissime rex quin cum ob alias rationes tum potissimum ob rei bellicae gloriam ordinis

ordinis negotia cognoscerent ad supremam vestram majestatem renuntiarent cum que decanus windesoriensis feodorum schedulam suprema vestra majestate pro externis principibus nec non omnibus subditis commilitonibus quam primum naugurati fuerint solvendorum tunc temporis exhibuerit cujus quidem schedulae aequitatem licet capitulum approbasset cum tamen controversia aliqua orta fuisset de installationis feodis quae canonicis pauperibus militibus ecclesiae windesoriensi solvi debent totius hujus causae cognitio praedicto deputato commilitonum conventui demandata erat ideo que henrico de vic equite cancellario doctore ryves decano windesoriensi scriba edvardo walker equite gartero conventui assistentibus scriba ordinis hujus totius causae narrationem datam die maii tunc temporis exhibuit cui quatuor commilitones deputati nomina sua subscripserant e quorum numero fuerunt duo nostrum qui nomina nostra infra apposuimus qua narratione plenissimis decani garteri rationibus que testimoniis privato sigillo munitis comprobatum reperimus feoda illae pro installatione principum externorum quae narratione ista exprimuntur illorum decessoribus ab omni memoria soluta fuisse ne que feoda illa superare quae subditi duce aut prioribus temporibus aut nuperrimis solverunt quoniam vero schedula superiori capitulo exhibita feodis per supremum solvendis initium sumat nullo tamen modo probari possit ullum unquam supremum feoda pro installatione sua solvisse aperte constet paucissimos admodum fuisse illustrissimi ordinis supremo qui inaugurati installationis feoda antea non solverant no narratione nostra feodorum istorum nullam mentionem fecimus quod ad feoda illa attinet quae ab extero rege solvenda sunt illa feodis istis quae suprema vestra majestate anno tunc temporis walliae principe soluta fuerunt omnino respondere pro comperto habemus installationis quo que feoda canonicis ecclesiae windesoriensi solvenda pro multis externis regibus supremo soluta fuisse garterus pro certo affirmavit canonicorum etiam ecclesiae windesoriensis feoda ab omnibus illustrissimi ordinis commilitonibus cujuscun que fuerint gradus seu duce marchiones comites vicecomites barones seu milites solvi debere scriba ordinis plenissimis testimoniis confirmavit garterus insuper affirmavit feoda pro omnibus gradibus jam memoratis ecclesiae windesoriensi folvenda illis etiam per omnia respondere quae elizabethae reginae jacobi regis carolus primo beatissimae memoriae temporibus nec non jam foelicissimo regiae vestrae majestatis reditu quam plurimis honoratissimis ordinis commilitonibus soluta fuere haec omnia una cum schedulis annexis ad supremae vestrae majestatis arbitrium humillime referimus ita omnia haec vestrae majestatis authoritate approbata illustrissimi ordinis registro inseri possint quoniam vero garterus eodem capitulo schedulam feodorum tam decano ecclesiae windesoriensi quam si nigrivirgifero officiariis armorum quam plurimis aliis regiae vestrae majestratis administris solvendorum exhibuerat quibus feodorum nomine gratificari soleat quae habita ratione graduum que dignitatum quibus commilitones insigniti sunt ad normam illorum feodorum exiguntur quae suprema vestra majestas tunc walliae princeps solvebat nobis omnino consentaneum videtur ut sola feoda gartero nigrivirgifero officiariis armorum solvenda approbentur que illustrissimi ordinis registro inserantur vt reliqua qua vera regiae vestrae majestatis administrorum feoda garteri billi inserta ipsu sigillo muniantur quolibet commilitone quam primum inauguratus fuerit exigantur ut que gartero c ilibet officiario secundum gradum suum prout antiquitus obtiu solvantur humilime insuper petimus ut si supremae vestrae majestati ita videbitur cancellarius mandatis habeat ut literae
