circumstance gave permission chuse christian arbitrator decision composing cause bring may sure nation became christian christian faith countenanced encouraged law established upheld would much allow christian arbiter judge appointed publick authority end common justice therefore farther say upon subject word text shall comprehended following particular first shall enquire reason st paul would christian make appeal bar unbelieving judge tribunal heathen magistrate secondly shall consider reason give christian may judge undertake office civil magistrate reason may assignd thirdly christian judge set apart appointed publick authority shall consider matter may brought according text said thing pertaining life commonly two sort 1 matter civil controversie betwixt one man another engaged suit law 2 criminal matter thing done contrary law offender evildoer punished according desert respect first shall consider far upon account christian may go law temper disposition mind occasion respect second shall consider reasonableness necessity lastly shall conclude inference whole may suitable present solemnity god blessing profitable u first shall consider reason st paul would christian make appeal bar unbelieving judge tribunal heathen magistrate thought sin cannot surely supposed appeald unto caesar act 2511 offered cause tryd bar one worst heathen thought since imagined dominion founded grace consequently heathen destitute divine grace mean obtaining dominion authority power world matter knew well dominion whomsoever lodged originally divine right power god power whether heathen christian ordained god rom 131 christ acknowledged authority pilate graceless heathen judge john 1911 christianity hath abrogated power civil magistrate hath divested right rule govern absolved men submission unto unless becomes christian certainly right priviledges temporal ruler governours whether king supream inferiour magistrate authorised sent end publick government better secured christian religion rom 13 5 person rule doctrine enjoynd obedience authority wrath also conscience sake 1 pet 213 14 design indeed earnestly desire conversion christian faith professing gospel christ cannot effected leaf exercise power notwithstanding therefore like reason st paul prohibited corinthian writes appealing unto impleading one another unjust unbelieving magistrate great scandal thereby raised upon ill report upon church christ great occasion thereby given heathen offended christ religion standing farther making profession christian church corinth st paul writes much given contention litigation amongst would wrong defraud one another 1 cor 68 whereupon suit law presently commenced ti likely prosecuted small heat passion therefore heathen brought cause heard tryd could discern much addicted fraud violence part occasiond suit impatient injury wrong done desirous revenge covetous worldlyminded litigious quarrelsome upon account christian exposed scorn derision religion brought contempt scandal authorised permitted irregularity disorder therefore apostle avoiding scandal fear giving offence enemy church great reason forbid going law unbeliever making appeal bar heathen judge prohibition may conceived respect common known saying amongst jew viz prosecuteth israelite tribunal gentile profanes name god besides one thing farther considered case namely heathen judge already sufficiently prejudiced christian power bar would sure treat utmost rigour severity nay moreover heathen unbeliever might presumed also unjust strictest sense word like unjust judge gospel neither feared god regarded man luke 182 justice equity could poor christian expect therefore st paul good reason say unto dare matter another go law unjust saint rather may also another reason forbad appeal heathen judge reflected upon wisdom authority church lookd none worthy fit honour therefore saith bring cause tryd infidel give occasion triumph exult must go law let done saint prohibition must look upon concern chiefly plaintiff bound sue belong defendant prosecuted bound stand tryal secondly thus come second place consider reason apostle give christian may judge undertake office civil magistrate although need reason given thing self evident plain general practice whereof declares reasonableness necessity yet apostle give considerable one deserves particular remark saint shall judge world yea even angel know saith saint shall judge world world shall judged ye unworthy judge smallest matter know ye shall judge angel much thing pertain life proper signification saint men holiness faithful servant god old testament new supposed required christian called unto holy calling without great apparent reason contrary ought charity presumed live answerably calling therefore may well accounted called saint although true called saint shall hereafter judge world lived according calling yet shall argument hold good therefore may judge magistrate better understanding necessary consider kind judicature saint shall exercise sense may said judge although may several way whereby may understood yet waving rest thinking needle trouble particular enumeration discussion shall present mention one plain natural apposite st paul intends viz lord christ god appointment designd supream judge world shall descend heaven end world judge quick dead saint god shall first judged absolved assumed assessor unto bear company judging condemning rest world say wicked men apostate angel explication seems reasonable best expositor agreed upon seems meaning saviour said apostle told son man shall sit throne glory also shall sit twelve throne judging twelve tribe israel mat 1928 saint god christian lived according holy profession great final judgment world shall vouchsafed honour assessor christ sit judgment wicked world shall thing matter high importance may reasonably enough accounted worthy judgment inferiour thing committed trust well may take upon power authority judge magistrate shall hereafter concernd adjudging eternal angel men reason st paul give christian may judge undertake office civil magistrate yet unsatisfied still unreasonable admit legal magistracy amongst christian reason unworthy consideration may alledged 1st find mentioned gospel christ high useful calling inconsistent profession unlawful christian bear office may sure either christ apostle would expresly forbidden done cannot conclude censure rash foolish condemn nay far christian religion interdicting christian many thing make manifestly civil magistrate ruler st paul said minister god rom 134 even profess faith christ much reasonably therefore may esteemd really read new testament eminent person great power authority disciple christ converted religion find laid office became christian besides christian magistrate governours judge amongst christian must either exposed confusion disorder ungovernd society lyable unto cannot imagine lord ever design must governd religion either enemy least good friend wellwishers favour kindness protection could expect nay would condition rather calamitous deplorable would magistrate judge christian give encouragement countenance christian religion would promote real interest church christ make prosper flourish ti scarce imaginable would government heathen ruler primitive christian sufferd greatest persecution could hope expect much peace prosperity till christianity became prosession king emperor therefore good christian benefit christ church furtherance gospel encrease true
