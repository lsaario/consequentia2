new method robert colepepyr gent speedy effectual preservation navigation river thames repair waterbreach havering dagenham level essex proponent many year spent thought tendancies tide ebb sand benefit navigation humbly proposes right honourable british house common parliament assembled new cutts made thames bank cheapest speedyest way perform work aforesaid approved best method hope enabled authority proceed notwithstanding statute contrary gentleman damage said navigation proponent apprehends following first water received inundation bason thereby cut upper part river make abatement waterdepth must inconsiderable since taken many mile length breadth water flow bason secondly sand bason damnifies navigation subsiding thames near breach true thames first entered bason failure sluice time enlarged passage yard broad also thames depth viz basons water fall river impossible tide could ever make high water bason thames could till long time breach much widened bason always receive tide soon innundation breach gave far le passage bason afterwards water made therefore may conclude soon inundation water remained flowing bason good part time thames ebbing water could come par thames must lower water could ebb bason reason great quantity water must remain bason next tide began flow thames yet quantity abate breach grew wider however may abated therefore time remaining water ebb bason meet first part next tide water stop swell one drop sullage till tide prevails give new motion whatever doth cause loss motion water give tendency drop sullage sand sullage subside drop encrease till want room tide ebb suffer rise higher storm disperse little sand though useful mouth river wind power yet provide second much greater damage thames navigation proponent prays leave observe follows wit four mile bank maintained keep thames drowning levell therefore imbanked flowing water four mile enter levell whereon rose heighth slowly thames water abated ebb therefore must high water time thames unimbanked land water would go latter long lowebb therefore sand could drop long contest tide ebb contest ebb water foot deep unimbanked marsh small quantity water long ebbing four mile passage thames abating foot heighth therefore little speed water made drown drain land last mentioned bore small proportion running tide ebb thames bank made gradually four mile passage would gradually given motion water flowed ebbed land bring swiftness running thames since lowvvater time deep vvaterfrett bason thames necessary prevent subsidence sand latter therefore proponent would make four new cutts thames bank benefit wide breach though cut low marsh surface cutts breach give much room proportion basons water thames channel give water flow bason must high low water thames deep water frett bason time little part ebb lest bason meet next tide cutting bank effectual way obviate subsiding sand thames take away cause thereof proponent would cutt much bank le serve however wider cutts hope appear able answer end aforesaid day preserve navigation also abate rapture main waterfrett material reparation may kept benefit obtainable cutting bank without risque failure since water build bank proponent would raise stop small wood new cutts foot high tide rise marsh surface water run stop risen foot higher flow freely stop till high water much help breach fill bason also make strong wood pile place rod within mouth breach stand deep water shallower water wood pile shoars fill sinking faggot made long wood pile shall broad said wood pile faggot water shall flow

wear wider water par side aforesaid till dagenham breach well repaired vvorks shall lie said guard protection tide ebb woodstops cutts shall raised little slower breach making new bank cutts good foundation shall last work draining level gentleman proponent unwilling good invention die idle project hope explained method preservation navigation repair breach aforesaid far may shew able perform much cheaper old way fighting vvater power method succeed well essex elsewhere established way great waterbreaches future many workman made able whence family ruined waterbreaches besides security marshland hereby considerably raise value le money shall spent repair vvaterbreach serviceable new method kingdom gentleman cutts appear necessary said service without excessive charge loss leg save life operation often venturd hope survive wooden leg shall good bank cutts done service objection made cutts proposed manner answered follows objection new cut become deep breach answer proponent say breach gain neither depth breadth year last stop failed gained passage enough fill empty bason moderate running marshchannels bear without enlargement precedent west thorack level inundation westerly wind cause highest tide thames destroy carry several part easterly bank level last mentioned made new breach little lower marsh surface breach abated water restraint tendency carry earth wider passage precedent thames mile lower dagenham well memory new cutt may two row board driven ground edgeway till upper edge appears row stand foot asunder water run edge board without fretting lower running foot frett board breadth ground must mount pas second row board board may ease doubtful mind otherwise seem needle objection cutts water entering breach since first inundation break bank three time drown large adjoining level soil fit bank wanting breach cutts may raise tide little higher feeble bank destroy answer bason four mile bank thames whose repair much neglected since inundation westerly wind blow highest tide feeble bank full easterly bank bason however new breach yet made quite part easterly bank feeble bank ought heighth strength thames bank since tide flow high cutts may make high water bason thames damage man thereby want good soile feeble bank earth rather mudd used much soaked every tide taken bason said bank new repaired least one third part water proponent apprehends water swell particle earth according quantity water bank dry water exhaled sun wind part earth shrink one drying till bank cleaves part cone many place receives much air formerly contained water month last repair bank proponent thereon sound many cone cone lying cross bank deep tide rise high enough enter cone breach soon made bank beyond michaelmas wind bank hardly stand better repaired mudd near new cutts better repair proponent intends lay earth come old bank foreland high heap sun wind may make dry fit well rammed upper two foot old bank way ought taken secure level danger either owner government otherwise land probably added inundation note work last mentioned answer objection bankcutting last made viz earth fit repair cutts therefore said feeble bank well repaired cutts thames
