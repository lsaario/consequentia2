frequently compared point vertue efficacy take away sin infinitely preferrd nature design expiatory sacrifice plainly substitute one living creature suffer die instead another sinner deserved suffered supposed done sacrifice slain make atonement sinner though reason hope effect blood bull goat living creature wont offered sacrifice yet jew heathen expect hope evident cannot without extreme ignorance obstinacy denyd expectation unreasonable soever plainly shews common apprehension mankind age god would appeased sin pardoned without suffering yet men generally conceived good hope upon repentance sinner god would accept vicarious punishment suffering stead probably said complyance apprehension mankind condescension well weighty reason best known divine wisdom god pleased find sacrifice really effectually procure great blessing forgiveness sin long hoped multitude sacrifice apostle hebrew doth large discourse shew great vertue efficacy sacrifice christ purpose remission sin sacrifice law death christ really effectually advantage sacrifice law supposed sinner saith apostle text end world hath appeared take away sin sacrifice great vertue efficacy sacrifice christ ever expected sacrifice either jew heathen really effected plainly signified jewish passover wherein lamb slain sinner escape passd allusion whereto st paul make scruple call christ passover paschal lamb

judge conferr reward eternal life upon partaker benefit sacrifice offered god u dayes flesh proceed iii iiid thing proposed yet remains spoken namely vindicate method dispensation divine wisdom objection brought shew nothing unreasonable wise unworthy god shall mention four objection commonly urged matter think considerable obj first method expiation sin suffering christ seems argue defect want goodness god needed external motive disposed forgive sinner think answer difficult namely god want goodness forgiven sin freely without satisfaction wisdom think meet give encouragement sin easy forgiveness without remarkable testimony severe displeasure therefore greater goodness compassion mankind devised way save sinner without giving least countenance encouragement sin god think saving u way excessive goodness mercy think way substituting dearly beloved son suffer stead condescension amazing god pleased goodness stoop almost blasphemy man thought desired secondly sin said obj forgiven freely pardon purchased dear rate mighty price paid answer desire two thing may considered wonderfull grace favour god admit translation punishment due u accept suffering another stead benefit might justly exacted u person even respect st paul say justified freely grace redemption jesus christ freely respect necessity lay upon god forgive u way free act goodness save u even satisfaction suffering son effect freely notwithstanding mighty price paid redemption price procuring god providing found ransom u man say prince prevails son intercede pardon rebel yea suffer punishment pay fine obtaining effect equitable gratefull construction forgive freely obj thirdly yet objected seems unreasonable sacrificing beast among jew nay sacrificing men among heathen even son daughter offering son god innocent excellent person ever answer consider manner design thing appear quite otherwise manner god command son sacrificed providence permitted wickedness violence men put death goodness wisdom overrule worst action best end consider matter aright reflection upon holy providence god enormity cruelty permission daily committed world consider end design permission christ death application purpose general expiation cannot acknowledge even adore gracious mercifull design mean god put end unreasonable bloody way worship long practised world one sacrifice infinitely dear god benefit expiation expected way sacrifice worthless vain comparison hath ever since obtained effect making sacrifice cease part world christianity hath prevailed fourthly last objection injustice obj cruelty innocent person suffering instead offender answer make great noise objection seem give full clear answer acknowledging constantly expressly saviour suffered benefit advantage though place stead apprehension plainly give cause unless shew good reason much injustice cruelty innocent person suffering benefit advantage malefactour suffering stead little men heat dispute opposition resolved hold

innocent person suffering benefit offender stead supposing suffering voluntary equally appearance injustice cruelty possibly discern reason injustice cruelty objected one case every whit little reason innocent person suffer benefit criminal suffer stead hope objection rest hath loudly invidiously urged hath received answer believe matter searched bottom perverse contention saviour suffering benefit stead signify nothing christ dyed benefit way vertue death suffering save u wrath god procure escape eternal death ought know body mean dying stead dy intention benefit another save death doth certainly intent purpose dye place stead grant meaning controversie end side agreed thing differ phrase manner expression seek quarrel occasion difference real ground thing ought far reasonable peaceable mind socinian say saviour voluntary obedience suffering procure exaltation right hand god power authority forgive sin give eternal life many pleased grant obedience suffering meritorious consequence redound benefit advantage much pretend say loth express term acknowledge christ dyed stead reason imagine denied often long appeal ingenuity adversary whether last issue come one part mere

malefactour upon fitting submission repentance advance honour man case allow king son sufferd instead malefactour smile man shall nice grant indeed suffered yet deny punishd allow bore inconvenience fault yet obstinately stand fault malefactour laid upon wise imputed said suffered stead case difference reallity last result thing nothing word thus far tryed patience contentious argument take pleasure yet shall glad may happy thing hath said contribute towards putting end unhappy controversie hath troubled world long raised dust able see clearly however cannot dismiss argument without making usefull short reflection upon great doctrine religion namely son god made sacrifice u exposed bitter suffering cruel death expiation sin create u greatest dread detestation sin ever deterr u wilfull transgression disobedience guilt sin done away upon hard term cost dearly beloved son god much sweat blood surely ought take great heed renewed provocation renew passion u lie crucifie self
