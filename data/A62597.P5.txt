good great blessing god bestowed upon whilst livd afterwards upon posterity world agree well enough first obvious sense word god abraham isaac jacob god alive still god posterity sake say three former

god world towards good men contrived may sufficiently appear wisely consider work god neglected yet outward blessing promiscuously dispensed man certainly concluded good man happiness enjoys life prosperity good men usually purpose shadowed mixed affliction may justly raise hope expectation perfect happiness better reward meet world general importance promise god god good men must necessarily
