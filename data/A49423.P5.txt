escape also man time deliberate deliberates never thing appeared make doubt consequence action follows opinion goodness harm action call voluntary lord understand right calleth spontaneous call voluntary action follow immediately last appetite voluntary one onely appetite one last besides see reasonable punish rash action could justly done man man unless voluntary action man said without deliberation though never sudden supposed time deliberate precedent time life whether kind action hence killeth sudden passion anger shall nevertheless justly put death time wherein able consider whether kill good evil shall held one continual deliberation consequently killing shall proceed election secondly conceive man deliberates whether shall thing doth nothing else consider whether better consider action imagine consequence good evil whence inferred deliberation nothing else alternate hope fear alternate appetite quit action deliberateth thirdly conceive deliberation say alternate

sick lame impediment sixthly conceive nothing taketh beginning self action immediate agent without self therefore first man hath appetite something immediately appetite cause self something else disposing whereas controversy voluntary action necessary cause said also caused thing disposeth followeth voluntary action necessary cause therefore necessitated seventhly hold sufficient cause nothing wanting needful producing effect also necessary cause possible sufficient cause shall bring forth effect wanteth somewhat needful producing cause sufficient impossible sufficient cause produce effect sufficient cause necessary cause said produce effect necessarily cannot produce hence manifest whatsoever produced hath sufficient cause produce else therefore also voluntary action necessitated lastly hold ordinary definition free agent namely free agent thing present needful produce effect nevertheless produce implies contradiction nonsense much say cause may sufficient

yet neither necessary seem avoid absurdity make distinction neither true determinatè indeterminatè distinction either signifies one true know necessity remains though know meaning distinction hath meaning might well said one true tytiricè neither tupatulicé last thing also consisteth whole controversie namely thing agent thing necessary action present nevertheless forbear produce one thing freedom necessity easily inferred hath alledged agent work work nothing wanting requisite produce action consequently cause action sufficient sufficient also necessary hath proved thus see

lieutenant giving god honour attribute action several lieutenancy shall ordain observation upon letter mr hobbs duke newcastle call opinion liberty necessity design letter speaks one part whole controversie consists voluntary agent always act necessarily one act without liberty necessity opinion first set 8 point title next part import many reason point first point spontaneity meant inconsiderate proceeding c without deliberation call first point find spontaneity described entrance reason declares design true saith somewhat bishop opinion concerning doubtfully cause shall find among maintain difference spontaneous voluntary action spontaneity consists inconsiderateness indeliberation would say must mean nothing whereas indeed adversary would well content mean nothing inconsideration privation want considering ought e agent reason say natural agent reason act inconsiderately water doth sponte fluere fire calefacere cannot say inconsiderately want deliberation capable might well say act want reason want reason deliberation make action spontaneous violent action would spontaneous also want reason natural agent water ascends want reason deliberation therefore next time mr hobbs mean play philosopher necessity liberty shall advise take better notice nature difference spontaneous voluntary action men call voluntary action word self import proceed ie

none apt though may sometimes used promiscuously voluntary spontaneous much already taken notice first point whether mistaken bishop make much either principal question liberty find mention spontaneity afterwards need enquiry nature definition voluntary action often use following discourse better worth labour examine defined action follow immediately last appetite voluntary acknowledge

strange impropriety speech 1 say deliberation act understanding either fear hope affection confusd tumbling together faculty soul becomes onely either understands desire understood perhaps meaning may understanding deliberation represents onewhile matter fear otherwhile hope confess true hope fear doth always produce resolution act upon action follows yet produce true perfect resolution act possible man true cause matter hope represented must least degree long hope impeachd new deliberation alike fear whosoever actually fear evil effectually will avoiding till something intervenes diverts fear next point third point defined last appetite immediately action appetite come upon men time deliberation intention inclination truth like point saith mr hobbs tried reflection upon self conceive speech usd nothing else last appetite methinks mr hobbs heard voluntas ambulatoria liable change therefore every last reflect shall find man seriously resolve day next day will man make testament also calld last indeed others resolvd act yet may change often men say ceaseth last ti true therefore something time last appetite cannot calld true changd last herein say consists liberty voluntary agent change make last last hath power last mean time last serious resolvd last action call intention inclination see reason called will seeing 1 act application soul thing upon reason proceed inferiour sensitive part therefore must either act nothing 2ly mr hobbes rule definition every one successive appetite will till another consequent appetite followed last time therefore course turn will indeed changed unwilled think man desire still called will cease fourth point say free agent one say hath made end deliberation shall call mr hobbs reflection whether man cannot said free hath made end deliberation rather desire friend dine meaning ask first whether ingaged resolvd company use word sir free answer free presently apprehend resolvd particular still capable resolution dine may said free hath made end deliberation another sence free doubt come deliberation may free also deliberation ended particular determination resolution freedom defend seems greater proper

absolve necessity take see advantage gotten mr hobbs reflection shews liberty necessity reflected also sixth point argument prove action necessitated necessary cause deny consequence sayes action necessary cause meaning meaning agree reason give necessary cause saith nothing beginning • self one imagine reflecting man think good consequence nothing beginning self therefore every thing necessitated effect must necessarily produced cause therefore cause necessarily produce effect good sir reflect bethink self effect cannot produced concurrence many cause together every one necessary producing effect yet one doth necessitate effect rather necessary nothing effected cause single alone seventh point another argument prove voluntary action necessitated sufficient cause sufficient

necessitated decree reprobation certainly man may damned without good llke manner evil elect doth sin also free necessity decree lay upon unless say necessary sin may saved decree unto life salvation 3 upon score adde decree layes necessity upon one action man doth onely election cannot necessitate man sin reprobation cannot necessitate man good also neither doth election necessitate man good

author agree nature decree yet agree denying consequence secondly prescience argument taken 1 though improper speech say god foresees thing must imply prius posterius action thing incompatible eternity present time yet cannot understand god action taking measure future thing seen u foreseen allow mr hobbs say thing future u though god yet foreseen provided use made argue foresight act past upon cause must depend effect must follow god vision doth prevent thing seen accompany thats nature every act supposes object kind meerly accidental nature lay necessity upon though hard comprehend
