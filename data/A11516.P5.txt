nationes vndique conuenerunt solum angliae regnum nec legatum eo aliquem misisse nec absentiam suam per nuntios aut liter excusasse sed sine consilio omnem prope rationem veteris avitae religionis immutasse quorum alterum superbae contumaciae videri ai alterum perniciosi schismatis nefas enim esse si quis sanctissimam authoritatem defugiat rom pont aut vocatus ab illo ad concilium se subducat controuersias autem de religione non alibi quam huiusmodi conuentibus fa esse disceptari ibi enim esse patriarchas episcopos ibi esse ex omni genere hominum viros doctissimos ab illorum ore petendam esse veritatem ibi esse lumen ecclesiarum ibi esse spiritum sanctum pios principe semper omnes si quid incidisset ambigui cultu dei illud semper ad publicam consultationem retulisse mosen iosuam dauidem ezechiam iosiam aliosque iudices reges sacerdotes de rebus diuinis non alibi quam episcoporum concilio deliber asse apostolos christi pios que patres inter se concilia celebrasse sic veritatem emicuisse sic expugnatas esse haereses sic arrium sic eunomium sic eutychetem sic macedonium sic pelagium succubuisse sic hodie dissidia orbis terrarum componi ruinas ecclesiae sarciri posse si positis contentionibus studijs veniatur ad concilium sine concilio autem quicquam religione tentari nefas esse atque haec quidem fere literarum tuarum summa fuit ego vero non id mihi nunc sumo vt tibi pro regno angliae quo quidque consilio factum sit quicquam respondeam neque te id requirere aut velle arbitror regum consilia recondita arcanum sunt esse debent nosti illud nec passim nec omnibus nec quibuslibet tamen pro nostra inter no veteri priuata consuetudine quoniam te id video ita prolixe petere quid mihi videatur breuiter amice respondebo sed ita vt ait ille quantum sciam poteroque idque tibi non dubito fore satis miramur inquis legatos ex anglia ad concilium non venire obsecro te angli solo ad concilium non veniunt ergo tu concilio interfuisti censum egisti caput singula enumerasti videbas alias nationes vndique omnes conuenisse praeter anglos quod si tibi mirari tam cordi est cur non miraris hoc quoque aut tres illos memorabiles patriarchas constantinopolitanum antiochenum alexandrinum aut presbyterum ioannem aut graecos armenios medos persas egyptios mauritanos aethiopas indos ad concilium non venire enim multi ex estis omnibus non credunt christum non habent episcopos non baptizantur nomine christi non sunt appellantur que christiani vero ab istis singulis nationibus venerunt legati ad concilium tu hoc potius dice papam illos non vocasse aut ilios ecclesiasticis vestris sanctionibus non teneri sed no hoc miramur magi papam eos quos inauditos indicta causa pro hereticis iam antea condemnauit publice excommunicatos pronunciauit eosdem postea vocare voluisse ad concilium homines enim primum damnari que affici supplicio deinde eosdem vocari iudicium absurdum est nonlatin alphabet verum hoc mihi velim responderi vtrum id agit pontifex vt nobiscum quos habet pro haereticis concilio de religione deliberet potius vt no ex inferiori loco causam dicamus vel statim mutemus sententiam vel iterum e vestigio condemnemur alterum nouum est prorsus nostrarum partium hominibus iam pridem iulio papa tertio denegatum alterum ridiculum est si id put anglos venturos esse ad concilium tantum vt accusentur causam dicant apud illum praesertim qui iamdudum non tantum nostris sed etiam suis grauissimis criminibus accusetur quod si anglia sola tibi adeo videtur esse contumax vbi ergo sunt legati regis daniae principum germaniae regis suetiae heluetiorum rhetiorum liberarum ciuitatum regni scotiae ducatus prussiae cum concilio vestro tot desiderentur nationes christianae ineptum est anglos solo numerare sed quid ego istos dico pontifex ipse ad concilium suum non venit cur tu hoc etiam non miraris quae enim est ista superbia vnum hominem animi causa cum libet conuocare omnes reges principe episcopos christianos eosque velle dicto esse audientes ipsum solum illorum conspectum non venire certe quum apostoli agerent conuentus hierosolymis petrus apostolus de cuius isti sede successione gloriantur abesse noluit verum opinor meminat pius papa quartus qui nunc pontificatum obtinet quid ioanni olim acciderit illum non satis auspicato venisse ad concilium constantiense venisse enim papam rediisse cardinalem itaque ex eo tempore pontifex cauerunt sibi post principia se continuerunt domi omnibus concilijs ac liberis disceptationibus obstiterunt nam ante annos quadraginta cum doctor martinus lutherus omnibus diris fulminibus pontifice peteretur quod docere cepisset euangelium ex verbo dei religionem instauraret summisse petijsset vt causa sua integra reijceretur ad cognitionem concilij generalis audiri non potuit vllo modo leo enim decimus papa satis videbat sire ad concilium redijsset suam etiam rem venire posse periculum seipsum fortasse audire ea posse quae nollet pulchrum quidem est nomen concilij generalis modo ita vt oportet conueniatur positis affectionibus omnia referantur ad praescriptum verbi dei vni veritati seruiatur si aperte religio pieta opprimatur si tyranni ambitio confirmetur si factionibus ventri libidini studeatur nihil potest cogitari ecclesiae dei perniciosius atque haec quidem hactenus ita dico quasi concilium istud quod tu dicis vsquam aut vllum sit quod ego prorsus nullum esse arbitror aut si vspiam aut vllum est certe obscurum valde arcanum est no enim quamuis non ita procul absumus tamen quid agetur qui episcopi conuenerint vel potius vlli omnino conuenerint scire adhuc nullo modo possumus immo etiam ante viginti menses cum concilium istud pontifice pio primum indiceretur ferdinandus imperator respodit quamuis aliaomnia conuenirent locum tamen quem papa delegerat sibi magnopere displicere tridentum enim etsi bella sit ciuitas tamen nec satis opportuna esse tot gentibus nec tantam frequentiam hominum quantum ad generale concilium conuenire par sit posse capere eadem fere ab alijs principibus christianis quibusdam etiam non paulo asperiora respondebantur itaque no ista omnia vnd cum concilio fumos abijsse credebamus sed obsecrote quis ille tandem est qui istud concilium indixit orbem terrarum conuocauit pius inquies papa quartus et cur ille potius quam episcopus tolletanus qua enim potestate quo exemplo primitiuae ecclesiae quo iure haec facit ita petrus linus cletus clemens edictis suis orbem terrarum commouerunt fuit hoc semper saluis rebus ius imperatorum romanorum proprium nunc autem postquam imminutae sunt vires imperij regna partem caesareae potestatis
