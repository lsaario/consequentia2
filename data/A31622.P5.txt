trade mostly come merchant tell time might laid money plentifully enough cloath serge lead tyn leather westindia good c without ever carrying away coin upon supposd necessity whenever value gold silver le forreigners tends lower commodity rent land guinea went abroad often carryed commodity left commodity thereby falling must need fall land rise tenant occupier land able sell produce cant pay
