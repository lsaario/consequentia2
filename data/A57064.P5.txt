deus prius praevideat qui credituri sint qui non quam aliquo eligat ad vitam alios destinet ad interitum jesuitae autem ponunt decretum absolutum fidem esse fructum vel effectum illud consequens iesuitae concedunt majorem gratiam quoad modum ii omnibus praeberi qui convertuntur quam ii qui non arminiani contra majorem etiam quoad modum saepe communicari non conversis quam conversis hinc etiam

infusa converti no deo modo certo nobis irresistibili dari infusionem hujusmodi gratiae renovantis sanantis voluntatem eamque inclinantis determinantis ad alterum oppositorum actu conversionis vel hinc constat quod omnes theologi ponunt voluntate habitualem aversionem deo habituale conversionem ad sen ibilia carnalia haec autem habitualis corruptio naturae solo gratiae merae excitantis auxilio sanari non potest morbi enim ut corporales sic spirituales non curantur nisi contrariis habitualis ergo corruptio non nisi habituali qualitate voluntati impressa mutari potest recte igitur prosper interior sensus non aperitur ad spiritualia praestanda donec fundamentum fidei fervor dilectionis corde plantetur nisi concedatur hujusmodi habitualem gratiam infundi voluntatem unde illa modo physico inclinetur ad bonum nullum erit homine formale principium quo actus boni possint elici sicut enim corporalibus nemo videt nisi prius oculum habeat nec audit nisi aures habeat sic spiritualibus nemo videt nisi prius deus oculos dedit ad videndum nec audit nisi cui aures ad audiendum eadem ratione nemo ad deum se convertere potest nisi habeat novum cor e novam voluntate ad convertendum deumque diligendum unde enim illud scripturis arbor mala malos fructus bona bonos fructus profert nisi ut inde intelligamus voluntatem bonam fieri oportere priusqua opus aliquod spirituale praestare possit quod gratia sanante regenerante non autem gratia excitante moraliter suadente fieri necesse est supponatur voluntatem corruptione habituali deformatam posse solo auxilio gratiae excitantis ad actus spirituales eliciendos elevari esset tamen id contra illa suavitatem providentiae divinae quae ab omnibus theologis praedicatur deus enim voluntate sic dispositam non suaviter promoveret sed quasi obtorto collo raptaret ad opus qua adhuc abhorret ejus inclinatio ergo magi consentaneum est ut ponamus voluntate habitualem quandam propensione ad bonum spirituale quod non gratia excitante sed ab infusione habitualis gratiae praestare potest fatentur omnes voluntatem non renatam nullam se habere principium e spirituale tamen actum convertendi ad deum non negabunt esse ordinis vere spiritualis supernaturalis quomodo autem voluntas solo pulsante gratia excitata non autem gratia regenerante mutata constituitur ordine agentium supernaturalium ego quidem non intelligo quaeram quid illud sit quod verum pium sanctu constituit non simpliciter actus pij boni actus enim non denominat subjectum tale ut loquitur philosophus ergo habitus sit oportet unde homo sanctus pius dicitur habitus aute iste situs non est irrationali animi parte ea enim non est culpae vel virtutis susceptiva proprie sed participative tantum quantum scil rationalis animi par eam redundat si autem rationali poni debet non est intellectu collocandus nemo enim est vir bonus vel malus quod bona vel mala tantu intelligat ut optime observat aquinas sed ideo dicitur unusque vir bonus vel malus quod ea velit quae mala vel bona sunt relinquitur ergo habitum sanctitatis non posse nisi voluntate collocari utpote quae proprissiime est subjectum susceptivum tu habitualis sanctitatis tum habitualis corruptionis rebellionis ei contrariae unde facilitas promptitudo operando si voluntas per se indifferens sit aequaliter inclinata utramque partem nam sicut ex mali actionibus contrahitur macula unde habitualiter disponitur

actum sed habitum permanente omnes melioris notae theologi fatentur habitus autem iste non intellectu locu habet quia affectus est nec sensuali appetitu qui ad amore spiritualem elevari nequit reliquu

quod onitatem malitim spiritualem impertitur omnibus operibus ab homine praestitis quam absurdu inquam est statuere hanc facultate nec spiritualem fuisse ante lapsum nec carnale post lapsum sed u corruptionis per primum peccatum invectae tum donorum spiritualiu hominis regeneratione infusorum esse penitus expertem facile esset pluribus absurdis obruere hanc sententiam sed haec sufficient ex omnibus satis constat infundi voluntatem vel ea imprimi novam qualitatem vel habitum gratiae quod ab arminianis acerrime negari ex ipsorum verbis supra probatum est qui tamen adhuc dubitat utrum haec sit eoru ententia legat coll hag p versione bertii ubi de industria consulto defendunt non spirituali morte separari dona spiritualia ab hominis voluntate nec ante illam morte nimirum statu

positis omnibus ad agendum requisitis restat nunc brevi probandum deum sive immediate sive mediate tum gratia infusa tum morali suasione peccatores irresistibili quodam modo ad se convertere sed haec cautio praemittenda est hoc vox irresistibiliter explicatur vocabulo irresistibiliter non intelligere no vim aliquam voluntati illatam ejusque naturae repugnantem sed inseparabilem tantum efficaciam gratiae divinae quae suaviter quidem secundum modu ejus naturae inclinat voluntatem ita tamen certo necessario intelligimus eam necessit tem quam modo certitudinem diximus ut voluntate eludi nequeat veritas hujus sententiae vel hinc patet quod passim scripturis deo solo ejusque nonlatin alphabet beneplacito tribuitur peccatoris conversio vel regeneratio homini ipsi autem omnis vel minimum cooperatio adimitur rom non est volentis vel currentis sed miserentis dei ille cujus vult miseretur quem vult indurat quod vere dici non posset si homo possit pro libertate sui arbitrii positis omnibus dei actionibus ad conversionem requisitis gratiam dei vivificam vanum accipere ut loquitur arm eamque irritam facere observetur etiam verbis non solummodo deo solo tribui quod hic resipiscat ille obduretur sed hominis voluntate conatu prorsus excludi quo minus aliquas habeat partes hoc negotio non est inquit volen vel currentis sed miserentis dei sicut rota non ideo bene currit ut sit rotunda sed quia prius est rotunda ideo bene currit sic homo non ideo vult vel currit ut deus ejus miserescat eum que regeneret per gratiam spiritus vivificam sed quia prius miseretur ideo vult ideo currit via justitiae secunda ratlo sumitur ab infallibili connexione effectus cum causa e conversionis cum gratia convertente vivificante nam si gratia haec vivifica semper attingit suum effectum nec cuiquam offertur nisi quo efficax sit ad animam ejus sanandam regenerandam necesse est ut praevalentem quanda irresistibilem operationem ei tribuamus gratiam autem istam nunquam non finem suum assequi omnibus quibus communicatur patet ex multis scripturae locis iohan ver quicquid dat mihi pater ad venit ier v converte ego convertar unde colligitur cuicunque infunditur gratia homini convertendo apta eum certo infallibiliter conversum iri alioquin non posset sic deum alloqui converte e fac quicquid tu adminiculo spiritus gratiae tuae infusione facere sol et ego convertar fortassis enim voluntas cui integrum est gratia accipere rejicere eam irritam faciat ide patet ex iohan v quicun que patre audivit et didicit veniet ad e quicun que ita audivit deo doctus est simul gratiam spiritus vivificam imbiberit acceperit certo veniet ad unde liquet gratiam homini convertendo idoneam nunquam frustrari sed modo quodam insuperabili effectum suum consequi ita ut ab humana voluntate nunqua eludi possit quod porro confirmatur natura gratiae modo illo praepotenti quo deus eam infundit cor humanum nam si gratia sit effectus infinitae potentiae sicut est eadem virtute homo regeneratur qua christus suscitatus est mortuis tum deus eam humanae voluntati ingenerando exerit omnipotentem illam virtutem cui nulla facultas creata obniti vel resistere potest accedit hoc argumentum gratia dei ita est causa efficiens conversionis ut nullam omnino causam sociam coordinatam secum admittat etiamsi causam sibi subordinatam scil humanam voluntatem adjunctam habeat vero si voluntas quando excitatur gratia assistentiae ut appellant possit ei resistere potest etiam eidem assistere si illi obniti potest etiam cum eadem eniti ad eundem effectum producendum denique si eam irritam facere tum eam efficacem reddere ideoque potest esse causa coordinata cum gratia dei primo actu suae conversionis eliciendo deum autem suo solius unius opere exclusis omnibus causi coordinatis homines regenerare vel convertere adeo liquido constat ut probatione non egeat nam passim habetur scripturis deus convert deus dat resipiscentiam deus circumcidit auferens cor lapideum substituens carneum ejus locum denique deus regenerat sua virtute resuscitat morte peccati omitto vim similitudinis sicut nemo ad sui resurrectionem ad sui generationem conferre quicquam potest sic neque ad regenerationem resurrectionem spiritualem deus inquam haec omnia praestat sed ei solo tribui non possent si haberet causam ita secum cooperantem ut si illa nolit nullus hujusmodi consecutus sit effectus ad haec verissimum est illud quod dicitur scholasticis deus est causa totius entis e etiamsi peccati quod non est en sed defectus entitatis facultati vel actui debitae inesse causa non sit efficiens deus sed deficiens voluntas tamen omnis boni operis quo genere prima conversio est praecipuum si plenissimum sit entitatis vel si totum sit en sicut est hujusmodi inquam operis totius deum esse causam necesse est deus enim solus est causa totius entis ubicunque reperitur etiam ipsius peccati quantu en est deum esse causam omnes theologi agnoscunt quamobrem e si voluntas sit causa efficiens conversionis secundaria subordinata unde hortantur no scripturae nosmet convertere corda nostra circumcidere sic deinc p tanquam causa tamen coordinata vivificae gratiae dei resistere eam que vanu accipere ut loquitur arm nullo modo potest addo etiamsi deus socium admitteret hoc opere tamen voluntatem quae est prorsus depravata mortua peccatis non posse magi cum gratia excitante pulsante cooperari quam cadaver fricacionibus praeparatum dispositum potest se ipsum resuscitare actu que vitales ex se exerere sed ut hanc rationem finiam supponatur posse voluntatem una cum dei gratia cooperari vel non cooperari pro innata libertate quantu tamen stante hac sententia derogatum erit de dei gloria homini arrogatum plusquam par est merito gloriari potest suum velle tantu contulisse ad regenerationem ut si noluisset nunquam sequutura fuisset sicut enim qui commonefactus ab alio dat eleemosynam illud opus bonu plus sibi refert acceptu quam suadenti excitanti sic cujus voluntas tantum pulsata commonefacta gratia assistentae se ad deum convertit suam conversionem plus vel aequaliter saltem sibi tribuit quam gratiae divinae quae nunquam id effectum datura fuisset nisi ipse ei consensisset ejusque suasionem ratam fecisset cum ejus potestate esset eam irritam reddidisse quarta ratio inde sumitur qd decretu electionis quo deus secu statuerat quosdam selectos ex massa communi servari absolutum sit suum ergo effectu necessario infallibiliter consequitur decretu electionis esse absolutum ita ut deo eligenti nihil obversetur electis praevisum sed omnes conditiones ad salutem requisitas eis ipse operari absolute decreverit adeo clare patet ex multis scripturae locis ut vix probatione egeat nam si non no deum eligimus sed ille nosmet iohn si ideo electi u essemus sancti non ideo sancti ut eligeremur si iacobum eligerit potius quam esavum cum utrique conditione omnin essent pares aequales ad rom si vocatio efficax fides justificans sint fructus vel effectus praedestinationis non conditiones praecedaneae ad rom denique si sola unica ratio decreti sit merum dei beneplacitum quorum vult miseretur quos vult obdurat tum necesse est deum absolute decrevisse quosdam servare eum finem gratiam sanctitatem fide ijs impertire quod vero deus ex concessis convertat omnes electos modo ab ijs irresistibili vel hinc liquet quod si illi resistere possint gratiae ijs convertendis aptae idoneae ad hunc finem communicatae ut converterentur tum eludi possit creatura absolutum hoc peremptorium dei decretum qd existimare fa non est nec est ut nunc obijciant pari ratione eos quos deus reprobaverit irresistibi iter peccare negamus enim rationem utriusque eandem esse nam etiamsi fides sit effectus praedestinationis tame infidelita non est effectus proprie dictus reprobationis cum fides requirat causam efficientem per se quae vere proprie influit suum effectum ad infidelitatem autem non requiritur causa efficien sed deficiens quippe quae sequitur ad merum defectum absentiam causae illius qua fides efficeretur sicut ad illumniandum aerem requiritur sol vel alia causa efficiens influens illum effectum sed ad obtenebrandum absentia solis sufficiat pari ratione etiamsi peccata reproborum sequuntur etiam infallibiliter ex determinato dei consilio qui eorum eventum decrevit tamen conversio fides sequuntur absolutum dei decretum modo multum dissimili peccata enim sequuntur infallibiliter quidem necessitate tantum consequentiae id est deo non omnino causante vel efficiente sed tantum permittente fides vero bona opera eitam necessitate consequentis ut pote quorum deus propriissime author dici debet secundum omnes theologos nemo enim unquam dixerit homines credere regenerari ad deum converti bona opera praestare deo tantum permittente sed etiam causante et operante si vero hoc nobis concessum fuerit sicut necesse est ut concedatur fidem conversionem sequi absolutum dei decretum necessitate consequentis e necessitate efficiente cooperante non video quomodo negari possit cam modo quodam irresi tibili nobis fieri cum enim aliquod agens ita agat patiens ut necessario vincat proprie dicitur agere irresistibiliter sic deus si ita convertat peccatorem ut necessario convertatur necessitate consequentis tum eum convertit irresistibiliter e modo cui patiens cedere necesse est vnde miror eos qui negant electionem ex fide praevisa pendentem defendere tamen conversionem fieri modo resistibili ut etiam frustrari possit quinta ultima ratio haec sit si conversio fiat modo illo resistibili sicut ab ijs describitur qui arm sequuntur tum electio divina non potest esse certa secundum ipsorum principia utpote quae pendeat mutabili hominis arbitrio quod ut describitur ab arminio ausim dicere deo ip praevideri non posse supponatur enim quod illi substituunt fundamentum illius praevisionis deum perfecte praevidere omnes modos quibus voluntas vel deordinari vel ad bonum inclinari possit supponatur etiam deum praecognoscere omnia objecta vel circumstantias quae possunt voluntati illo modo offeri vel exhiberi denique supponamus etiam deum exploratum habere quomodo unumquodque objectum vel circumstantia apta sit movere voluntatem eamque huc vel illuc suadendo impellere tamen fi haec sit conditio voluntatis ut positis quibuscunque objectis etiam pofita quac nque aptitudine objectis vel circumstantijs ad inclinandam voluntatem huc vel illuc illa tamen pro intrinseca libertate possit agere vel non agere non video quomodo deus praevidere possit quid voluntas certo infallibiliter sit operatura e utrum se convertet ad deum necne non quod deus ex aliqua impotentia non possit expiscari quid voluntas conatura sit sed quia id non est simpliciter scibile nam non potest esse major certitud cognitione quam objecto unde sic argume tor si certum sit voluntatem gratiae oblatae assensuram esse tum alsu est dictu volunt positis omnibus dei actionibus posse se convertere vel non convertere contra si incertum sit utrum voluntas huic gratiae r sist necne tum ea quam de illa habet deus praescientia certa esse nequit nam scibile est mensura scienti ergo scientiam sse veram tamen plus esse certitudinis cognitione quam cognita mplicat contradictionem sicut implicatur contradictio si quis dixerit mensuratum esse majus vel minus mensura tamen eidem aequale esse ad haec etiamsi verum sit deum cognoscere omnes modos secundum quos voluntas bene vel male inclinari potest tamen si voluntas sit omnimodo indeterminata admittens nullum determinans sive intrinsecum sive extrinsecum sive creatum sive increatum ut illi defendunt implicat contradictionem ut ab ipso deo definiatur aliquis certus modus quo illam deordinari vel recte ordinari contigerit ex omnibus colligitur si gratia convertens moveat voluntatem modo ab illa resistibili non posse deum infallibiliter praesc qui credituri int qui non unde ex consequenti omni e medio tol retur electio ergo reliquum est gratiam convertentem irresistibili tum deo communicari
